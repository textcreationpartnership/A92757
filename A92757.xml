            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E cannot ſuppoſe here that words will be needed to raiſe opinion; yet it may be expected we ſhould give ſome account of what we have done, and we will do it. Not long agone we printed that excellent col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Letters known by the name of <hi>Cabala,</hi> which the world has ſeen and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. Since, another volume of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters hath come to our hands; a volume which may juſtly be called a ſecond <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bala,</hi> not unworthy to keep that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb facs="tcp:125863:3"/>a part which muſt add much to the other, as illuſtrious in its titles, as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable and as weighty for the matter. In which, beſides not a few noble monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the former years from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting of the Roman Church by our great <hi>Henry</hi> downward, of his daughter the moſt glorious virgin Queens life and government recorded, ſome of the ſame great actions are begun, many continued; much of the policie, contrivances, and workings of the ſame ſucceeding Princes and their Miniſters, of the carriage of the ſame things farther proſecuted, and more fully diſcovered. Like ſiſter-twins of lovely faces they have both apart their native ſweetneſs, their ſeveral worths and graces; yet they are not ſo fully taking, ſo perfectly beautiful, as where they are drawn together in one frame. In the new more is diſcovered, not only of the foreign affairs in <hi>Germany, Italy,
<pb facs="tcp:125863:3"/>France, Spain,</hi> and other Countries whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the intereſt of the late Reignes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the Soveraign actors; but of our home-Councels, Orders, and proviſions both for the Church and Common-wealth, enough to ſhew the prudence, judgment; and foreſight of thoſe who ſwayed in chief then, and to let us know now the Ages paſt have had the honour to be governed by men, who did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all things to fortune; who if they could not aſſure themſelvs of the events, yet they could command; deſign, and underſtand: Their deſigns and counſels (which will be admirable to ſome, but ridiculous to others) being ever directed and ruled by equity and juſtice, ever aiming at honeſt ends, ſuch as may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture abroad, ſuch as will appear fair and handſom in the light: whereas if we caſt our eys upon the Popes in the ſame leafs, we ſhall find nothing but combuſtions,
<pb facs="tcp:125863:4"/>nothing but fire, brimſtone and alarums to war and blood. If upon the <hi>French,</hi> nothing but inhumane cruelty and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence upon the conſcience too. If upon the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> nothing but artifice, nothing but cunning perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; all their plots and conſultations, their cheating Treaties, tending meerly to the advancement of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> houſe, without any reſpect to piety and juſtice, faith or honour. A taſte of which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs we find in this ſecond Part, where the Spaniſh Match is firſt moved by the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> the grand Minion in <hi>Philip</hi> the 3. his reign; this Duke damns himſelf in oaths for his ſincerity and reality toward the Match, which <hi>Olivarez,</hi> the preſent Kings Favourite, tels his Maſter here was never intended. It would be too tedious but to touch in paſsing by, upon the generals in theſe Letters; upon the calamities and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb facs="tcp:125863:4"/>of the Palatine <hi>Germans,</hi> of the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots,</hi> the ſiege and taking in of <hi>Rochel, &amp;c.</hi> Hereſie and Superſtition every where triumphing over truth. To ſpeak of the ſpirit and worthines of our Hero's were impoſsible; we might cull out ſome Letters here, of which (were there no more) might be ſaid,</p>
            <q>
               <l>— An hand or eye</l>
               <l>By <hi>Hyliard</hi> drawn, is worth a Hiſtory.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Of theſe Letters we may ſafely be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, though they come out thus late, and are ſo little known, their merit will eaſily weigh down the age and fame of thoſe which have gone before.</p>

            <head>King <hi>HENRY</hi> the 8. to the Clergie of the Province of <hi>York,</hi> An. 1533. Touching his Title of <hi>Supreme Head of the Church of England.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Reverend Father in God, Right truſty and welbeloved, We greet you well, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived your Letters dated at <hi>York</hi> the 6. of <hi>May,</hi> containing a long diſcourſe of your mind and opinion concerning ſuch words as hath paſſed the Clergie of the Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in the Proeme of their Grant made unto us, the like whereof ſhould now paſs in that Province. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ye interlace ſuch words of ſubmiſſion of your Judgment, and diſcharge of your duty towards us with humble fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion and behaviour, as we cannot conceive diſpleaſure nor be miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with you, conſidering what you have ſaid to us in times paſt in other matters, and what ye confeſs in your Letters your ſelf to have heard and known, noting alſo the effect of the ſame; We cannot but marvail at ſundry points and Articles, which we ſhall open unto you, as hereafter followeth.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ye have heard (as ye ſay ye have) the ſaid words to have paſſed in the Convocation of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where were preſent ſo many learned in Divinity and Law, as the Biſhops of <hi>Rocheſter, London, S. Aſſaph.</hi> Abbots of <hi>Hyde, S. Bennets,</hi> and many other; and in the Law the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Bath;</hi> and in the Lower Houſe of the Clergie ſo many notable and great Clerks, whoſe perſons and learning you know well enough. Why do ye not in this caſe with your
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:125863:8"/>ſelf as you willed us in our great matter, conform your conſcience to the conſcience and opinion of a great number? Such was your advice to us in the ſame (our great matter) which now we perceive ye take for no ſure counſel; for ye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>earch the grounds, not regarding their ſayings. Nevertheleſs foraſmuch as ye examine their grounds, cauſes and reaſons, in doing whereof ye ſeem rather to ſeek and examine that thing which might diſprove their doings, then that which might maintain the ſame, We ſhall anſwer you briefly without long diſcourſe to the chief points of your ſaid Letters: wherein taking for a ground, that words were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to ſignifie things, and cannot therefore by ſiniſter interpretation alter the truth of them, but only in the wits of perverſe perſons that would blind or colour the ſame, by reaſon whereof to good men they ſignifie that they mean only doing their office, and to men of worſe ſort they ſerve for maintenance of ſuch meaning as they would imagine: ſo in uſing words we ought only to regard and conſider the expreſſion of the truth in convenient ſpeech and ſentences, without overmuch ſcruple of ſuper-perverſe interpretations, as the malice of men may excogitate: wherein both overmuch negligence is not to be commended, and too much diligence is not only by daily experience in mens writings and laws ſhewed fruſtrate and void; inſomuch as nothing can be ſo cleerly and plainly written, ſpoken and ordered, but that ſubtile wit hath been able to ſubvert the ſame; but alſo the Spirit of God, which in his Scripture taught us the contrary, as in the places which ye bring in &amp; reherſe:— if the Holy Ghoſt had had regard to that which might have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly conſtrued of theſe words, <hi>Pater major me eſt;</hi> and the other, <hi>Ego &amp; Pater unum ſumus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> there ſhould have been added to the firſt <hi>huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas,</hi> to the ſecond <hi>ſubſtantia.</hi> And wherefore doth the Scripture call Chriſt <hi>primogenitum?</hi> whereupon, and the Adverb <hi>donec,</hi> was maintained the error <hi>contra perpetuam virginitatem Mariae.</hi> Why have we in the Church S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtle, which S. <hi>Peter</hi> writeth to have been the occaſion of errors? Why did Chriſt ſpeak of many words, which the Jews drew <hi>ad calumniam,</hi> and yet reformed them not? as when he ſaid, <hi>Solvam Templum hoc, &amp;c.</hi> meaning of his body, where <hi>Templum</hi> with them had another ſignification; And ſuch other like? There is none other cauſe but this, <hi>Omnia quae ſcripta ſunt, ad noſtram doctrinam ſcripta ſunt.</hi> And by that Learning we ought to apply and draw words to the truth, and ſo to underſtand them as they may ſignifie truth, and not ſo to wreſt them as they ſhould maintain a lye. For otherwiſe as Heretiques have done with the holy Scripture, ſo ſhall all men do with familiar ſpeech; and if all things ſhall be brought into familiar diſputation, he that ſhall call us <hi>Supremum &amp; unicum Dominum,</hi> by that means, and as goeth your
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:125863:8"/>argument, might be reproved: For Chriſt is indeed <hi>unicus Dominus &amp; Supremus,</hi> as we confeſs him in the Church daily; and now it is in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that <hi>Sancti</hi> be not Mediators: The contrary whereof ye affirm in your Letters, becauſe of the Text of S. <hi>Paul, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nus eſt Mediator Deum &amp; hominum.</hi> And after that manner of reaſon which ye uſe in the entry, if any man ſhould ſay, This Land is mine own, and none hath right in it but I; he might be reproved by the Pſalm, <hi>Domini eſt terra:</hi> For why ſhould a man call <hi>terram aliquam</hi> onely his, whereof God is the chief Lord and Owner? Why is it admitted in familiar ſpeech to call a man dead, of whom the ſoul which is the chief and beſt part yet liveth? How is it that we ſay this man or that man to be founder of this Church, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in one reſpect God is only founder? We ſay likewiſe that he is a good man to the Church, a ſpecial benefactor of the Church: and that the Church is fallen down, when the ſtones be fallen down, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple preſerved and living. And in all this manner of ſpeech when we hear them, it is not accuſtomed ne uſed to do as ye do, that is to ſay, to draw the word <hi>Church</hi> to that ſentence wherein the ſpeech may be a lye, but to take it in that wherein it ſignifieth truth. Which accuſtomed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner if ye had followed, you ſhould not have needed to have laboured ſo much in the declaration of the word <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> in that ſignification where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is moſt rarely taken, and cannot without maintenance of too mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt a lye be applied to any man. For taking <hi>Eccleſia</hi> in that ſenſe ye take it, S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote amiſs writing to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Eccleſia Dei quae eſt Corinthi:</hi> for by your definition, <hi>non circumſcribitur loco Eccleſia.</hi> In the Goſpel where Chriſt ſaid <hi>Dic Eccleſiae,</hi> muſt needs have another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation and definition then ye make <hi>de Eccleſia</hi> in your ſaid Letters, or elſe it were hard to make complaint to all Chriſtendom, as the caſe in the Goſpel requireth. <hi>Sed eſt candidi pectoris verba veritati accommodare, ut ipſam referre quod eorum officium eſt non corrumpere videantur.</hi> Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more the Lawiers that write how <hi>Eccleſia fallit &amp; fallitur,</hi> what blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my do they affirm, if that definition ſhould be given to <hi>Eccleſia</hi> which you write in your Letters, wherein albeit ye write the truth for ſo far, yet for as much as ye draw that to the words ſpoken of us to the reprobation of them, yet ye ſhew your ſelves contrary to the teaching of Scripture, rather inclined by applying a divers definition to make that a lye which is truly ſpoken, then <hi>genuino ſenſu addita &amp; candida interpretatione</hi> to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the ſame. It were <hi>nimis abſurdum,</hi> Us to be called <hi>Caput Eccleſiae repreſentans corpus Chriſti myſticum, &amp; Eccleſiae quae ſine ruga eſt &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula quam Chriſtus ſibi Sponſam elegit, illius partem vel oblatam accipere vel arrogare.</hi> And therefore albeit <hi>Eccleſia</hi> is ſpoken of in theſe words, touched in the Proeme, yet there is added, <hi>Et Cleri Anglicani:</hi> which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:125863:9"/>words conjoined reſtraineth by way of interpretation the word <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiam,</hi> and is as much to ſay as the Church, that is to ſay the Clergy of <hi>England.</hi> Which manner of ſpeaking in the Law ye have profeſſed ye many times finde, and likewiſe in many other places.</p>
            <p>But proceeding in your ſaid Letter, ye have ſhewed Chriſt to be <hi>Caput Eccleſiae,</hi> ye go about to ſhew how he divided his power in earth after the diſtinction <hi>temporalium &amp; ſpiritualium,</hi> whereof the one ye ſay he committed to Princes, the other <hi>Sacerdotibus;</hi> for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ye alleadg Texts which ſheweth and proveth obedience due to Princes of all men without diſtinction, be he Prieſt, Clerk, Biſhop, or Lay-man, who make together the Church: and albeit your own words make mention of temporal things, wherein ye ſay they ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed; yet the Texts of Scripture which ye alleadg having the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral words <hi>obedite &amp; ſubditi eſtote</hi> contain no ſuch words, whereby ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al things ſhould be excluded; but whatſoever appertaineth to the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of mans life is of neceſſity included, as the words plainly import, as ye alſo confeſs; wherefore <hi>Gladium portat Prince ps</hi> not only againſt them that break his Commandment and Laws, but againſt him alſo that in any wiſe breaketh Gods Law; For we may not more regard our Law then God, ne puniſh the breach of our Laws, and leave the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor of Gods Laws unreformed: ſo as all ſpiritual things by reaſon whereof may ariſe bodily trouble and inquietation, be neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in Princes Power, and ſo proveth the Text of Scripture by you alleadged: and alſo the Doctors by you brought in, confirm the ſame. After that ye intend to prove, which no man will deny, the miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſpiritual things to have been by Chriſt committed to Prieſts to Preach and miniſter the Sacraments, them to be as Phiſicians to mens ſouls; but in theſe Scriptures neither by ſpiritual things ſo far extended, as under colour of that vocabule be now adaies, ne it proveth not that their office being never ſo excellent, yet their perſons, acts and deeds, ſhould not be under the power of their Prince by God aſſigned, whom they ſhould knowledg as their Head; the excellency of the matter of the Office doth not alwaies in all points extoll the dignity of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Chriſt who did moſt perfectly uſe the Office of a Prieſt, <hi>&amp; nihil aliud quam vere curavit animas,</hi> gainſaid not the authority of <hi>Pilate</hi> upon that ground; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> executing the Office of a Prieſt, ſaid, <hi>ad tribunal Caeſaris ſto, ubi me judicari oportet:</hi> And commanded likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinctly all others to obey Princes, and yet unto thoſe Prieſts being as members executing that Office, Princes do honour, for ſo is Gods plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and commandment; wherefore howſover ye take the words in the proheme, we indeed do ſhew and declare that Prieſts and Biſhops
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:125863:9"/>preaching the word of God, miniſtring the Sacraments according to Chriſts Law, and refreſhing our people with ghoſtly and ſpiritual food, we not only ſuccour and defend them for tranquility of their life, but alſo with our preſence, and otherwiſe doe honour them as the caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, for ſo is Gods pleaſure: Like as the husband, although he be head of the wife, yet ſaith S. <hi>Paul, Non habet vir poteſtatem ſui cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ris, ſed mulier,</hi> and ſo is in that reſpect under her: And having our Mother in our Realm, by the commandment of God we ſhall honour her, and yet ſhe for reſpect of our dignity ſhall honour us by Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment likewiſe: And the Miniſter is not always the better man, <hi>ſed cui miniſtratur;</hi> the Phyſitian is not better then the Prince, becauſe he can do that the Prince cannot, viz. <hi>curare morbum.</hi> In conſecration of Archbiſhops, do not Biſhops give more dignity by their miniſtration then they have themſelves? The Doctors ye bring in, taking for their Theme to extoll Prieſthood, prefer it to the dignity of a Prince; after which manner of reaſoning it may be called <hi>dignius imperare affectibus quam populis,</hi> and ſo every good man in conſideration of every dignity to excell a King not living ſo perfectly as he doth. And why is a Biſhop better then a Prieſt, ſeeing and conſidering in the matter of their office <hi>Epiſcopus etiam ſi adminiſtret plura, non tamen adminiſtrat majora.</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors and Princes obey Biſhops and Prieſts as doers of the meſſage of Chriſt, and his Ambaſſadors for that purpoſe: which done, <hi>ſtatim fiunt privati,</hi> and in order and quietneſs of living knowledge Princes as head. For what meant <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Emperor to make Laws <hi>de Epiſcopis &amp; Clericis,</hi> and ſuch other ſpiritual matters, if he he had not been perſwaded <hi>Illi eſſe curam Eccleſiae à Deo mandatam?</hi> This is true, that Princes be <hi>filii Eccleſiae,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>illius Eccleſiae</hi> which ye define: wherewith it may agree that they be nevertheleſs <hi>Suprema Capita</hi> of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Chriſtian men in their Countries; like as in ſmaller number of Chriſtian men, <hi>Non eſt abſurdum vocare Superiores capita,</hi> as they be called indeed, and may be called <hi>Primi &amp; Supremi,</hi> in reſpect of thoſe Countries. And why elſe doth the Pope ſuffer any other beſides himſelf to be called Archbiſhop, ſeeing that he himſelf indeed challengeth to be <hi>Princeps Apoſtolorum &amp; Epiſcoporum</hi> in <hi>Peters</hi> ſtead, which the name of an Archbiſhop utterly denieth. But by addition of the Country they ſave the ſenſe: whereunto in us to be called <hi>Eccleſiae Anglicanae</hi> ye at the laſt agree, ſo that there were added <hi>in temporalibus;</hi> which addition were ſuperfluous, conſidering that men being here themſelves earthly and temporal, cannot be head and Governor to things eternal, nor yet ſpiritual, taking that word <hi>ſpiritual</hi> not as the common ſpeech abuſeth it, but as it ſignifieth indeed: For, <hi>quae ſpiritu aguntur, nulla lege eſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntur,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:125863:10"/>as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Quae Spiritu Dei aguntur libera ſunt.</hi> And if ye take <hi>Spiritualibus</hi> for Spiritual men, that is to ſay, Prieſts, Clerks, their good acts and deeds worldly, in all this both we and all other Princes be at this day chief and heads, after whoſe ordinance either in generall or in particular they be ordered and governed. For, leaving old ſtories, and conſidering the ſtate of the world in our time, is there any Convocation where Laws be made for the order of our Clergy, but ſuch as by our authority is aſſembled? And why ſhould not we ſay as <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> ſaid, <hi>Omnia noſtra facimus quibus à nobis impartitur aucthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas?</hi> Is any Biſhop made but he ſubmitteth himſelf to us, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth himſelf as Biſhop to be our ſubject? Do not we give our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and aſſent to the election of Abbots? And this is concerning the Perſons and Laws ſpirituall. As touching their goods, it is in all mens opinions learned in our Laws, <hi>Extra controverſiam,</hi> that debate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie of them appertaineth to our deciſion and Order. And as for the living of the Clergy, ſome notable offences we reſerve to our corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſome we remit by our ſufferance to the Judges of the Clergy; as murther, felony and treaſon, and ſuch like enormities we reſerve to our examination; other crimes we leave to be ordered by the Clergy; not becauſe we may not intermeddle with them, for there is no doubt but as well might we puniſh adultery and inſolence in Prieſts, as Emperours have done, and other Princes ate this day do; which ye know well enough; ſo as in all thoſe Articles concerning the perſons of Prieſts, their Laws, their Acts and order of living, foraſmuch as they be indeed all temporall, and concerning this preſent life only, in thoſe we (as we be called) be indeed in this Realm <hi>Caput;</hi> and becauſe there is no man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove us here, be indeed <hi>ſupremum Caput.</hi> As to ſpiritual things, meaning by them the ſacraments, being by God ordained as inſtruments of efficacy &amp; ſtrength, whereby grace is of his infinite goodneſs conferred upon his people; foraſmuch as they be no worldly nor temporal things, they have no worldly nor temporall head but only Chriſt that did inſtitute them, by whoſe ordinance they be miniſtred here by mortal men, elect, choſen and ordered as God hath willed for that purpoſe, who be the Clergy; who for the time they do that, and in that reſpect <hi>tanquam miniſtri ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantur in his quae hominum poteſtati non ſubjiciuntur, in quibus ſi male ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantur ſine ſcandalo Deum ultorem habent ſi cum ſcandalo hominum cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio &amp; vindicta eſt.</hi> Wherein, as is before ſaid, either the Prince is chiefe doer, r his authority proceeded to the execution of the ſame; as when by ſufferance or priviledge the Prelats intromit themſelves therein; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that which is derived from the Prince at the begining, why ſhould any obſtacle or ſcruple be to call him Head from whom that is derived?
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:125863:10"/>Such things as although they be amongſt men, yet they be indeed <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, quoniam ſupra nos ſunt nihil ad nos.</hi> — And being called Head of all we be not in deed nor in name to him that would ſincerely underſtand it head of ſuch things being not ſpirituall as they be not temporall, and yet to thoſe words ſpoken of us <hi>adevitandam illam calumniam,</hi> there is added <hi>quantum per legem Chriſti licet;</hi> for interpretation of which Parentheſis your ſimilitude added of <hi>homo immortalis eſt quantum per naturae legem licet,</hi> is nothing like; for <hi>naturae lex</hi> is not immortality, as is <hi>lex Chriſti</hi> to ſuperiority: for <hi>lex naturae</hi> ne ſpeaketh, ne can mean of any immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality at all, conſidering that the law of Nature ordaineth mortality in all things; but Chriſts law ſpeaketh of ſuperiority, admitteth ſuperiority, ſheweth alſo and declareth <hi>obediendum eſſe Principibus,</hi> as yee do alledge. Wherefore if the law of God permitteth ſuperiority, and commandeth obedience: to examine and meaſure <hi>modum obedientiae &amp; ſuperioritatis,</hi> there can to no other thing ſo good a relation be made. For as yee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Scripture, though it ſay nay to part, it ſaith not nay to the whole, whereas nature denieth utterly all immortality; and ſo though in ſpeaking of immortality of man it were ſuperfluous to ſay <hi>quantum per naturae legem licet;</hi> yet is not ſo ſpeaking <hi>de ſuperioritate &amp; modo Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipatus,</hi> referring the certain limits to the law or Chriſti, <hi>ad cujus normam quicquid quadrat planum &amp; rectum eſt, quicquid non quadrat pravum &amp; iniquum.</hi> And as touching the doubt and difficulty you make to give a ſingle anſwer yea or no, for that the queſtion propounded containeth two things, whereof the one is true th'other falſe, as yee ſay, meaning as yee write, that in <hi>temporalibus</hi> we be <hi>Caput,</hi> and in <hi>ſpiritualibus</hi> we be not. It ſeemeth that neither your example agreeth in ſimilitude with that yee bring it in for, nor is there in learning or common ſpeech uſed the ſcrupuloſity in anſwers yee write of. Truth it is, that the queſtion in plain words containeth two parts expreſsly, whereof the one is true, th'other falſe; our yea or nay cannot be anſwered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for there ſhould appear a manifeſt lye, which Gods law deteſteth, and naturally is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred: as if it ſhould be asked Us, if We were King of <hi>England</hi> and of <hi>Denmark</hi> our nay or yea ſhould not ſuffice: But it is farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe both in matters of Learning and common ſpeech, where the words in the queſtion may by divers interpretations or relations contain two things, and yet in expreſſion contain but one: As if a man ſhould ask Us, <hi>An filius &amp; pater unum ſunt?</hi> We would not doubt to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer and ſay, Yea, as the Scripture ſaith, for it is truly anſwered, and to make a lye is but Sophiſtication, drawing the word <hi>unum</hi> to perſon, wherein it is a lye.

            <p>For that which is in Scripture written is a moſt certain truth; and as it is there written, ſo and no otherwiſe would Chriſt have anſwered, if the queſtion had been asked <hi>An Pater eſſet major illo?</hi> he would have ſaid yea, as it is written. And if the <hi>Arrians</hi> would have taken for a truth that of him that is truth, and ſpeaketh truth, and from whom proceedeth but truth, they would have brought a diſtinction with them to ſet forth truly, and not diſprove that it was truly written, by ſophiſtication of the word. When S. <hi>James</hi> wrote, <hi>Fides ſine operibus mortua eſt,</hi> he wrote truth; and ſo did S. <hi>Paul, Quod fides juſtificat abſque operibus legis:</hi> which it could not do, if it were <hi>mortua.</hi> Either of theſe made a ſingle aſſeveration of a ſentence, by interpretation containing two; truſting that the Reader would <hi>pio animo</hi> ſo underſtand them, as their ſayings might, as they do indeed, agree with truth. It is never to be thought men will willingly &amp; without ſhame lye; And therefore the ſenſe, if any may be gathered true, or like to be true, is to be taken, and not that which is a lye. And when we write to the Pope <hi>Sanctiſſimo,</hi> we mean not holier then S. <hi>Peter,</hi> though it ſound ſo; and he that in our Letters ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that, ſhould be thought ridiculous. He that ſhould ſay he rode be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſea, were not conveniently interrupted in his tale by him that would object ſailing upon the ſea, where he could not ride at all. And rather then men would note a lye when they know what is meant, they will ſooner by allegory or methaphor draw the word to the truth, then by cavillation of the word note a lye. Hath not the Pope been called <hi>Caput Eccleſiae?</hi> and who hath put any addition unto it? Have not men ſaid that the Pope may diſpence <hi>cum Jure divino,</hi> and yet in a part <hi>Juris divini,</hi> viz. <hi>moralis &amp; naturalis,</hi> the ſame men would ſay he might not diſpence: wherefore if in all other matters it was never thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient to ſpeak abſolutely the truth without diſtinction, why ſhould there be more ſcruple in our caſe? The truth cannot be changed by words: that we be, as Gods law ſuffereth us to be, whereunto we do and muſt conform our ſelves. And if ye underſtand, as ye ought to underſtand <hi>Temporalibus</hi> for the paſſing over this life in quietneſs, ye at laſt deſcend to agree to that which in the former part of your Letters you intend to impugne; and ſticking to that, it were moſt improperly ſpoken to ſay, We be <hi>illus Eccleſiae Caput in temporalibus,</hi> which hath not <hi>temporalia.</hi>

            <salute>SIR,</salute>
            <p>YOur Graces diſpleaſure and my impriſonment are things ſo ſtrange unto me, as what to write or what to excuſe I am altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. Whereas you ſend unto me (willing me to confeſs a truth, and ſo to obtain your favour) by ſuch a one whom you know to be my ancient profeſſed enemy, I no ſooner received this meſſage, then I rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived your menning: And if, as you ſay, confeſſing a truth indeed may procure my ſafety, I ſhall with all willingneſs and duty perform your command; but let not your Grace ever imagine that your poor wife will ever be brought to acknowledg a fault, where not ſo much as a thought ever proceeded: And to ſpeak a truth, never Prince had wife more loyal in all duty and in all true affection, then you have ever found in <hi>Anne Bullen:</hi> with which name and place I could willingly have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented my ſelf, if God and your Graces pleaſure had ſo been pleaſed. Neither did I at any time forget my ſelf in my exaltation, or received Queenſhip, but that I always look'd for ſuch an alteration as now I find, the ground of my preferment being on no ſurer foundation then your Graces fancie, the leaſt alteration whereof I knew was fit and ſufficient to draw that fancie to ſome other ſubject.</p>
            <p>You have choſen me from a low eſtate to be your Queen and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, far beyond my deſert or deſire. If then you find me worthy of ſuch honour, Good your Grace let not any light fancie or bad councel of my Enemies withdraw your Princely favour from me; neither let that ſtain, that unworthy ſtain of a diſloyal heart towards your good Grace ever caſt ſo foul a blot on your moſt dutiful wife, and the Infant-Princeſs your daughter. Try me, good King, but let me have a lawful trial, and let not my ſworn enemies ſit as my accuſers and Judges: yea let me receive an open Trial, for my truths ſhall fear no open ſhames: then ſhall you ſee either my innocencie cleered, your ſuſpition and conſcience ſatisfied, the ignominy and ſlander of the world ſtopped, or my guilt openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. So that whatſoever God or you may determine of me, your Grace may be freed from an open cenſure; and my offence being ſo lawfully proved, your Grace is at liberty both before God and man, not only to execute worthy puniſhment on me as an unfaithfull wife,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:125863:12"/>but to follow your affection already ſetled on that party for whoſe ſake I am now as I am, whoſe name I could ſome while ſince have pointed to, your Grace being not ignorant of my ſuſpition therein. But if you have already determined of me, and that not only my death, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous ſlander muſt bring you the enjoying of a deſired happineſs, then I deſire of God that he will pardon your great ſin herein, and likewiſe my enemies the inſtruments thereof, and that he will not call you to a ſtrict accompt for your unprincely and cruel uſage of me at his general Judgment-ſeat, where both you and my ſelf muſt both ſhortly appear, and in whoſe juſt judgment I doubt not, whatſoever the world may think of me, my innocencie ſhall be openly known and ſufficiently cleered.</p>
            <p>My laſt and onely requeſt ſhall be, That my ſelf may bear the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of your Graces diſpleaſure, and that it may not touch the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſouls of thoſe poor Gentlemen who as I underſtand are in ſtrait impriſonment for my ſake. If ever I have found favour in your ſight, if ever the name of <hi>Anne Bullen</hi> have been pleaſing in your ears, let me obtain this laſt requeſt, and I will ſo leave to trouble your Grace any further, with my earneſt prayers to the Trinity to have your Grace in his good keeping, and to direct you in all your actions.</p>

            <p> ALthough I and this Councel have by our joynt-Letters truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto you the dutifull ſtate of things here, and the cauſes both foraign and domeſtical whereupon we gather it; and withall have ſhewed our extreme wants, and what ſupplies are deſired: Yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:125863:15"/>thence, but not from your Lordſhips, (for I have had no kind of advertiſements, anſwer, or reſolution from the ſame theſe twelve moneths) that there is a great preparation made by the Spaniſh King againſt the Realm, and that your Lordſhips have intelligence thereof; I cannot but as one whoſe chief charge and care it is, importune your Lordſhips to caſt your eye more carefully this way, humbly praying you to conſider what caſe we are in to try with a moſt mighty Prince, whether this Realm ſhall be ſtill her Majeſties or his, if there be any ſuch matters (as your Lordſhips know beſt) then I beſeech your Lordſhips to think whether it be more ſafety to ſay that we have ſent proviſion to encounter the danger, or elſe you will ſend when perhaps it will be too late. And withall for mine own diſcharge, if I ſhall tarry, and have nothing wherewith: I have but a life to yield for her Majeſty and my Country; for the loſs thereof I grieve not, but rather for the harm that through defects I fear may come to her Majeſty and the State, and the ſhame I ſhall leave behind me. This foreign preparation, if there be any ſuch thing, is likely to be ſpent againſt <hi>Munſter,</hi> to ſeiſe upon and to ſpoil the Cities and Towns of the ſame, which in truth are very weak. If I ſhall go thither, what for the late wars, and this laſt bad ſeaſon, there is not ſo much to be had there as will maintain that one Band of 200. that is under Mr. <hi>Thomas Norris</hi> the Vice-Preſident there, but that I am inforced to ſhift them from Town to Town, who by reaſon of their extreme penury do receive them with great grief and grudge. And though I had men ſufficient to encounter the Enemy that ſhould come, yet for want of victuals I ſhould be driven to abandon the place with danger and ſhame, where they that are to come over are like to bring their proviſion with them, and to ſettle it in ſome Town that they will ſoon ſeiſe upon for that purpoſe: whereof what may enſue amongſt this unconſtant people naturally delighting in change, your Lordſhips may ſoon gather. Beſides this that I have ſaid of the bare eſtate of <hi>Munſter,</hi> where there is not ſo much to be had as will ſerve for mine own family, or yet to feed my horſes till graſs grow, I refer you to underſtand not only the ſame more fully, but alſo the great wants of the reſt of the Realm by the declaration here incloſed, which as <hi>Beverley</hi> the Victualler maketh it, ſo I know it to be true. And therefore I moſt humbly beſeech your Lordſhips to ſend ſpeedy order, that ſuch a Staple of victuals may be provided and be ſent over, as your Lordſhips ſhall think requiſite to ſerve as well for the numbers here already, as alſo for thoſe that are to be ſent over to encounter ſuch an accident as may fall out. And herein I would wiſh your Lordſhips to conſider the winds and weather, how untowardly they have framed this year: for as ſome have lain at <hi>Cheſter</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:125863:16"/>nine weeks to come over hither, ſo hath there been no paſſage ſince this ſix weeks. Moreover if there be ſuch purpoſes in hand, it were good ſome ſhipping were diſpatcht for the guard of the Coaſts. And to all theſe and other difficulties, may I with your Lordſhips favour adde one more to be conſidered of, How weakly I am ſeconded, if need fall out by thoſe forein attempts, whereof I would ſay little for any other cauſe: The Marſhal is old, and not able either to ride on go; the Maſter of the Ordnance is both abſent, and old, and I wiſh there were a more ſufficient man in his place: The Lord Preſident and Sir <hi>William Stanley,</hi> who are men of good conduct, are drawn away: Sir <hi>H. Harrington,</hi> Mr. <hi>Edward Barkley,</hi> and the Seneſcal <hi>Dantry</hi> are ſuffered to remain ſtill there; but I humbly pray they may be ſped away, together with all other that are Servitors by any manner of pay there. And ſo having herein diſcharged my duty, I humbly end.</p>

            <p> GReat is my grief when I think how heavily her Majeſty is bent to diſfavour me; and howbeit I carry the name of an undutifull Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, yet God knoweth that my heart and mind are always moſt lowly inclined to ſerve my moſt loving Prince, ſo it may pleaſe her Highneſs to remove her heavy diſpleaſure from me. As I may not condemn my ſelf of diſloyalty to her Majeſty, ſo cannot I excuſe my faults, but muſt confeſs that I have incurred her Majeſties indignation; yet when the cauſe and means which were found and deviſed to make me commit folly ſhall be known to her Highneſs, I reſt in an aſſured hope that her moſt gracious Majeſty will both think of me as my heart deſerveth, and alſo of thoſe that wrung me into undutifulneſs, as their cunning device me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riteth.

            <p>IT may pleaſe your Majeſty, a rumor hath been raiſed not long ſince at <hi>Dublin</hi> (I know not how, nor by what particular perſon, but ſtrongly confirmed ſince the laſt paſſage out of <hi>England</hi>) (neither doth your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice now in hand upon this Northern border, ſuffer me to examine it) that your Majeſty conceived ſome hard opinion of me, from which your Highneſs is not yet removed; but what the offence is, or how concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is neither by the reporters publiſhed, nor ſecretly revealed unto me: And like as it is caſie to judge what effects this may work in the ſervice of your Majeſty, or to a man in publick office, as I am, in ſuch a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as this is, where the obedience for the moſt is conſtrained, and all reputation with the people either growing or diminiſhing as your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty graceth or diſgraceth your Officers; ſo how much this quiet burthen over-preſſeth my moſt devoted and dutifull mind towards your Majeſty. I feel to my exceeding grief and diſcomfort. In examining my ſelf in what root this your judgment ſhould ſpring, I confeſſe Madam, I have view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my ſelf many imperfections, ſome in nature, others perhaps for lack of ability and ſufficiency to be a cooperator or an aſſiſtant in ſo great and ſo tickliſh a government &amp; charge, into which not ambition in me, but your Majeſties wil &amp; commandment hath intruded me. But in all that my memory can hitherto preſent unto me, I find my loyalty in your ſervice, and my ſincerity in imploying your Majeſties treaſure according to your intent, ſo unſpotted and direct, as I cannot but comfort my ſelf in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing my innocency to the envy of the informer, or to any other his hard conſtruction whatſoever: yet ſince in generall conſideration I cannot feel ſuch a particular error, as might ſettle in your Majeſties grave judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, an offence meriting your disfavour, I am moſt humbly to beſeech your Majeſty, that by knowing my fault I may either purge my ſelf by a juſt deniall, or by confeſſing it crave pardon of your Highneſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my ſelf.

To repeat many ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and by-matters, as of my acquaintance with you, and ſuch like, it will be fitter for ſuch a time when I ſhall have conference with you. But in effect, our end was thus: I made her Majeſty ſee, what in your health, in your fortune, and in your reputation with the world you had ſuffered ſince the time that it was her pleaſure to comit you; I told her how many friends and well-wiſhers the world did afford you, and how for the moſt part, throughout the whole Realm her beſt ſubjects did wiſh that ſhe would do her ſelf the honour to repair for you, and reſtore to you that ſtate which ſhe had overthrown; your humble ſuffering of theſe harms, and reverend regard to her Majeſty, muſt needs move a Princeſs ſo noble and ſo juſt, to do you right; and more I had ſaid, if my gift of ſpeech had been any way comparable to my love. Her Majeſty ſeeing her judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment opened by the ſtory of her own actions, ſhewed a very feeling compaſſion of you, ſhe gave you many praiſes, and among the reſt, that which ſhe ſeemed to pleaſe her ſelf in, was, that you were a man of her own choyce.

My beginning was, as being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others intreated to move her in your behalf: my courſe was to lay open your ſufferings and your patience; in them you had felt poverty, reſtraint and diſgrace, and yet you ſhewed nothing but faith and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; faith, as being never wearied nor diſcouraged to do her ſervice; humbleneſs, as content to forget all the burthens that had been laid upon you, and to ſerve her Majeſty with as frank and willing a heart as they that have received greateſt grace from her. To this I received no anſwer but in generall terms, that her honour was much touched, your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption had been intolerable, and that ſhe could not let it ſlip out of her mind. When I urged your acceſs, ſhe denied it, but ſo as I had no cauſe to be afraid to ſpeak again. When I offered in them both to reply, ſhe fell into other diſcourſe, and ſo we parted. So all that I have done you know; what I ſhall do ye ſhall preſcribe. If you hear any mans elſe — I pray you let me know, for ſo I ſhall perceive whether ſhe will open her heart more to me then them, which being known I may deal accordingly. And ſo I commit you to God.</p>

            <p> VPon this unhappy accident, I have tryed to the bottom what the Queen will do for you, and what the credit of your Sollicitor is worth. I urged not the compariſon between you and any other: But in my duty to her, and zeal to her ſervice, I did aſſure her that ſhe had not any other in <hi>England</hi> that would for theſe three or four years know how to ſettle himſelf to ſupport ſo great a burthen. She gave me leave to ſpeak, heard me with patience, confeſſed with me that none was ſo ſufficient, and could not deny but that which ſhe lays to your charge was done without hope, fear, malice, envy, or any reſpect of your own, but meerly for her ſafety both of ſtate and perſon. In the end ſhe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely denied to let you enjoy that place, and willed me to reſt ſatisfied, for ſhe was reſolved. Thus much I write to let you know, I am more honeſt to my friends, then happy in their caſes. What you will have me do for your ſuit, I will as far as my credit is any thing worth. I have told moſt of the Councel of my manner of dealing with the Queen; my Lord Chamberlain tells me he hath dealt for you alſo, and they all ſay they wiſh as I do; but in this world that is enough. I will commit you to God for this time, and reſt</p>

            <p>MY dutiful affections to your Majeſty always overweighed all other worldly reſpects; that ſeeking in all particulars to manifeſt my truth, I have maimed my eſtate in general, as I dare in the heat of my thoughts compare with the greateſt that ever vowed for faithful ſervice, ſo is there not the meaneſt that hath overſlipped me, I will not ſay in recompence, but in ſome gracious eſtate of ſervice.

Though I have no hope to repair the ruines of my overſight, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but preſume your Majeſty will ſuffer me to preſerve them from blowing up; and what youth and forward belief hath undermined in mine eſtate, providence by a retired life may underlay. In which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance from Court there ſhall be added (if any thing be added) increaſe of loyalty: Nor ſo ſolitary ſhall be my courſe, as it ſhall ſeem to proceed of diſcontentment, but of neceſſity; and all actions both with living and my life ſo forward, as though ſome may have overrun me in fortunes, none ſhall in duty.</p>

That of late (by what ſecret and venemous blow I know not) my faith hath received ſome wounds, your Majeſties wonted grace withdrawn aſſures me: But truth and my patience in this caſe were one with me, and time in your Princely thoughts did wear it out from me. Let time be Judge; I will leave you with as great lothneſs as I were to loſe what I love beſt. But your favour failing, in which I have placed all my hopes, and my ſelf leſs graced after ſeven years then when I had ſerved but ſeven dayes, may be a reaſon to excuſe, if there were no other reaſon. Theſe things preſſed out of a diſtreſſed mind, and offered in all humility, I hope it ſhall not be offenſive if I chooſe this weariſom courſe, rather to be retired then tired. If any of envy take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of abſence, ſeeking by cunning to draw me into ſuſpition of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment, my conſcience is ſetled in your never erring Judgment, that if he come with <hi>Eſau's</hi> hands and <hi>Jacob's</hi> voice, your Highneſs will cenſure it a wrought malice under ſuch ſimplicity. It is true that grief cannot ſpeak; but this grief hath made me write, leſt when I leave you I ſhould ſo far forſake my ſelf as to leave this unſaid. To your gracious acceptance I commit it, and with all humble and reverent thoughts that may be, reſt ever to be commanded to die at your Majeſties feet,</p>

            <p> IT is often ſeen, that he that ſtands by ſeeth more then he that playeth the game; and for the moſt part every one in his own cauſe ſtandeth in his own light, and ſeeth not ſo cleerly as he ſhould. Your Lordſhip hath dealt in other mens cauſes, and in great and weighty affairs with great wiſdom and judgment; now your own is in hand, you are not to contemn or refuſe the advice of any that love you, how ſimple ſoever. In this order I rank my ſelf among others that love you, none more ſimple, and none that love you with more true and honeſt affection; which ſhall plead my excuſe, if you ſhall either miſtake or miſtruſt my words or meaning: but in your Lordſhips honorable wiſdom I neither doubt nor ſuſpect the one nor the other. I will not preſume to adviſe you, but ſhoot my bolt and tell you what I think. The beginning and long continuance of this ſo unſeaſonable diſcontentment you have ſeen and proved, by which you aim at the end: If you hold ſtill this courſe, which hitherto you find to be worſe and worſe, (and the longer you go, the further you go out of the way) there is little hope or likelihood the end will be better: You are not yet gone ſo far, but that you may well return: The return is ſafe, but the progreſs is dangerous and deſperate in this courſe you hold. If you have any enemies, you do that for them which they could never do for themſelves: Your friends you leave to ſcorn and contempt, you forſake your ſelf and overthrow your fortunes, and ruinate your honour and reputation: You give that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and courage to the foreign enemies, as greater they cannot have;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:125863:22"/>for what can be more welcome and pleaſing news then to hear that her Majeſty and the Realm are maimed of ſo worthy a Member, who hath ſo often and ſo valiantly quailed and daunted them? You forſake your Country, when it hath moſt need of your Councel and aid: And laſtly you fail in your indiſſoluble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> duty which you owe unto your moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soveraign, a duty impoſed upon you not by nature and policie only, but by the religious and ſacred bond wherein the divine Majeſty of Almighty God hath by the rule of Chriſtianity obliged you.</p>
            <p>For the four firſt, your conſtant reſolution may perhaps move you to eſteem them as light; but being well weighed, they are not light, nor lightly to be regarded. And for the four laſt, it may be that the cleerneſs of your own conſcience may ſeem to content your ſelf, but that is not enough; for theſe duties ſtand not only in contemplation or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward meditation, and cannot be performed but by external actions, and where that faileth, the ſubſtance alſo faileth. This being your preſent ſtate and condition, what is to be done? what is the remedy, my good Lord? I lack judgment and wiſdom to adviſe you, but I will never want an honeſt true heart to wiſh you well; nor being warranted by a good conſcience, will fear to ſpeak that I think. I have begun plainly, be not offended if I proceed ſo. <hi>Bene cedit qui cedit tempori:</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, <hi>Cedendum eſt fortunae.</hi> The medicine and remedy is not contend and ſtrive, but humbly to yield &amp; ſubmit. Have you given cauſe, and yet take a ſcandal unto you? then all you can be is too little to make ſatisfaction. Is cauſe of ſcandal given unto you, yet policie, duty and religion enforce you to ſue, yield and ſubmit to our Soveraign, between whom and you there can be no equal proportion of duty, where God requires it as a principal duty and care to himſelf, and when it is evident that great good may enſue of it to your friends, your ſelf, your Country, and your Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, and extreme harm by the contrary. There can be no diſhonour to yield; but in denying, diſhonour and impiety. The difficulty (my good Lord) is to conquer your ſelf, which is the height of true valour and fortitude, whereunto all your honorable actions have tended. Do it in this, and God will be pleaſed, her Majeſty (no doubt) well ſatisfied, your Country will take good, and your Friends comfort by it; and your ſelf (I mention you laſt, for that of all theſe you eſteem yourſelf leaſt) ſhall receive honour; and your Enemies (if you have any) ſhall be diſappointed of their bitter ſweet hope.</p>
            <p>I have delivered what I think ſimply and plainly, I leave you to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine according to your own wiſdom: if I have erred, it is <hi>error amoris,</hi> and not <hi>amor erroris.</hi> Conſtrue and accept it, I beſeech you, as I meant i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>MY very good Lord, though there is not that man this day living whom I would ſooner make Judge of any queſtion that might concern me, then your ſelfe; yet you muſt give me leave to tell you, that in ſome caſes I muſt appeal from all earthly Judges: And if in any, then ſurely in this, when the higheſt Judge on earth hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon me the heavieſt Puniſhment without triall or hearing. Since then I muſt either anſwer your Lordſhips Arguments, or elſe forſake mine own juſt defence, wil force mine aking head to do me ſervice for an hour. I muſt firſt deny my diſcontentment (which was forced) to be an humorous diſcontent; and in that it was unſeaſonable, or is ſo long continuing, your Lordſhip ſhould rather condole with me then expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late: naturall ſeaſons are expected here below, but violent and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſtorms come from above: There is no tempeſt to the paſſionate of a Prince, nor yet at any time ſo unſeaſonable as when it lighteth on thoſe that might expect an harveſt of their carefull and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full labours. He that is once wounded muſt needs feel ſmart till his hurt be cured, or the part hurt become ſenſleſs. But cure I expect none, her Majeſties heart being obdurate; and be without ſenſe I cannot, being of fleſh and blood. But you may ſay, I may aim at the end: I do more then aim, for I ſee an end of all my fortunes, I have ſet an end to all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. In this courſe do I any thing for mine enemies? when I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I found them abſolute, and therefore I had rather they ſhould tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph alone, then have me attendant upon their Chariots: Or do I l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> for their
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:125863:23"/>love to me. Or do I forſake my ſelf? becauſe I do not enjoy my ſelf? Or do I overthrow my fortunes, becauſe I build not a fortune of paper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walls, which every puff of wind bloweth down? Or do I ruinate mine honor, becauſe I leave following the purſuit, or wearing the falſe mark or the ſhadow of honor? Do I give courage or comfort to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, becauſe I neglect my ſelf to encounter them, or becauſe I keep my heart from buſineſs, though I cannot keep my fortune from decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? No, no, I give every one of thoſe conſiderations his due right, and the more I weigh them, the more I find my ſelf juſtified from offending in any of them. As for the two laſt objections, that I forſake my Countrey when it hath moſt need of me, and fail in that indiſſoluble duty which I owe to my Soveraign: I anſwer, That if my Countrey had at this time any need of my publick ſervice, her Majeſty that governeth it, would not have driven me to a private life. I am tied to my Countrey by two bonds; one publick, to diſcharge carefully and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly that truſt which is committed to me; the other private, to ſacrifice for it my life and carkaſſe, which hath been nouriſhed in it. Of the firſt I am free, being diſmiſſed by her Majeſty: Of the other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can free me but death, and therefore no occaſion of performance ſhall ſooner offer it ſelf, but I will meet it halfe way. The indiſſoluble duty I owe unto her Majeſty, the ſervice of an Earle and of Marſhall of <hi>England,</hi> and I have been content to do her the ſervice of a Clerk; but I can never ſerve her as a villain or a ſlave. But you ſay I muſt give way to time. So I do, for now that I ſee the ſtorm come, I have put my ſelf into harbour. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, we muſt give way to Fortune: I know that Fortune is both blind and ſtrong, and therefore I go as far as I can out of the way. You ſay the remedy is not to ſtrive: I neither ſtrive nor ſeek for remedy. But you ſay, I muſt yeild and ſubmit: I can neither yeild my ſelf to be guilty, nor this my impriſonment lately laid upon me, to be juſt; I ow ſo much to the Author of Truth, as I can never yeild Truth to be Falſhood, nor Falſhood to be Truth. Have I given cauſe, you ask, and yet take a ſcandall? No, I gave no cauſe to take up ſo much as <hi>Fimbria</hi> his complaint: for I did <hi>totum telum corpore accipere,</hi> I patiently bear and ſenſibly feel all that I then received when this ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall was given me. Nay, when the vileſt of all indignities are done unto me, doth religion enforce me to ſue? Doth God require it? Is it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety not to do it? Why? cannot Princes erre? Cannot ſubjects re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive wrong? Is an earthly power infinite? Pardon me, pardon me, my Lord, I can never ſubſcribe to theſe principles. Let <hi>Solomons</hi> fool laugh when he is ſtricken; let thoſe that mean to make their profit of Princes, ſhew to have no ſenſe of Princes injuries; let them acknowledge
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:125863:23"/>an infinite abſoluteneſs on earth, that do not believe an abſolute infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in heaven. As for me, I have received wrong, I feel it; my cauſe is good, I know it; and whatſoever comes, all the powers on earth can never ſhew more ſtrength or conſtancy in oppreſſing, then I can ſhew in ſuffering whatſoever can or ſhall be impoſed upon me. Your Lordſhip in the beginning of your Letter makes me a Player, and your ſelf a loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker on; and me a player of my own game, ſo you may ſee more then <hi>I;</hi> but give me leave to tell you, that ſince you do but ſee, and <hi>I</hi> do ſuffer, <hi>I</hi> muſt of neceſſity feel more then you. <hi>I</hi> muſt crave your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips patience to give him that hath a crabbed fortune, leave to uſe a crooked ſtile.

            <p> THis ſtanding at a ſtay doth make me in my love towards your Lordſhip jealous leſt you do ſomwhat, or omit ſomwhat that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth to a new error: For I ſuppoſe that of all former matters there is a full expiation; wherein for any thing which your Lordſhip doth, I for my part (who am remote) cannot caſt or deviſe wherein my error ſhould be, except in one point, which I dare not cenſure nor diſſwade: which is, that as the Prophet ſaith, in this affliction you look up <hi>ad manum percutientem,</hi> and ſo make your peace with God. And yet I have heard it noted, that my Lord of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> who could never get to be taken for a Saint, yet in the Queens disfavour waxed ſeeming religious. Which may be thought by ſome, and uſed by others as a caſe reſembling yours, if men do not ſee, or will not ſee the difference between your two diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. But to be plain with your Lordſhip, my fear rather is, becauſe I hear how ſome of your good and wiſe friends, not unpractiſed in the Court, and ſuppoſing themſelves not to be unſeen in that deep and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrutable Center of the Court, which is her Majeſties mind; do not only toll the bell, but even ring out peals, as if your fortune were dead and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:125863:24"/>buried, and as if there were no poſſibility of recovering her Majeſties favour; and as if the beſt of your condition were to live a private and retired life, out of want, out of peril, and out of manifeſt diſgrace. And ſo in this perſwaſion to your Lordſhip-wards, to frame and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date your actions and mind to that end, I fear (I ſay) that this untimely deſpair may in time bring forth a juſt deſpair, by cauſing your Lordſhip to ſlacken and break off your wiſe, loyal, and ſeaſonable endeavour and induſtry for reintegration to her Majeſties favour, in compariſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all other circumſtances are but as <hi>Atomi,</hi> or rather as a <hi>Vacuum</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſubſtance at all.</p>
            <p>Againſt this opinion it may pleaſe your Lordſhip to conſider of theſe reaſons which I have collected; and to make judgment of them, neither out of the melancholy of your preſent fortune, nor out of the infuſion of that which cometh to you by others relation, which is ſubject to much tincture, but <hi>ex rebus ipſis,</hi> out of the nature of the perſons and actions themſelves, as the trueſt and leſs deceiving ground of opinion. For though <hi>I</hi> am ſo unfortunate as to be a ſtranger to her Majeſties eye, much more to her nature and manners, yet by that which is extant <hi>I</hi> do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly diſcern that ſhe hath that character of the Divine nature and goodneſs, as <hi>quos amavit, amavit uſque ad finem;</hi> and where ſhe hath a creature, ſhe doth not deface nor defeat it: inſomuch as if <hi>I</hi> obſerve rightly in thoſe perſons whom heretofore ſhe hath honoured with her ſpecial favour, ſhe hath covered and remitted not only defections and ingratitudes in affection, but errors in ſtate and ſervice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. if I can Scholar-like ſpell &amp; put together the parts of her Majeſties proceedings now towards your Lordſhip, <hi>I</hi> cannot but make this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, That her Majeſty in her Royal intention never purpoſed to call your doings into publique queſtion, but only to have uſed a cloud without a ſhower, and cenſuring them by ſome reſtraint of liberty and debarring from her preſence. For both the handling the cauſe in the Star-chamber was inforced by the violence of libelling and rumours, wherein the Queen thought to have ſatisfied the world, and yet ſpared your appearance: And then after, when that means which was intended for the quenching of malicious bruits, turned to kindle them, becauſe it was ſaid your Lordſhip was condemned unheard, and your Lordſhips Siſter wrote that private Letter, then her Majeſty ſaw plainly that theſe winds of rumours could not be commanded down without a handling of the Cauſe by making you party, and admitting your defence. And to this purpoſe <hi>I</hi> do aſſure your Lordſhip, that my Brother <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> who is too wiſe to be abuſed, though he be both reſerved in all particulars more then is needfull, yet in generality he hath ever conſtantly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:125863:24"/>and with aſſeveration affirmed to me, That both thoſe dayes, that of the Star-chamber, and that at my Lord Keepers, were won of the Queen meerly upon neceſſity and point of honour, againſt her own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the laſt proceeding I note three points which are directly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, that her Majeſty did expreſly forbear any point which was ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recuperable, or might make your Lordſhip in any degree uncapable of the return of her favour, or might ſix any character indeleble of diſgrace upon you: For ſhe ſpared the publick places, which ſpared ignominie; ſhe limited the Charge preciſely not to touch diſloyalty, and no Record remaineth to memory of the Charge or Sentence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The very diſtinction which was made in the ſentence of Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the places of ſervice in State, and leaving to your Lordſhip the place of Maſter of the Horſe, doth in my underſtanding point at this, that her Majeſty meant to uſe your Lordſhips attendance in Court, while the exerciſes of other places ſtood ſuſpended.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I have heard, and your Lordſhip knoweth better, that now ſince you were in your own cuſtody, her Majeſty <hi>in verbo Regio,</hi> and by his mouth to whom ſhe committeth her Royal grants and Decrees, hath aſſured your Lordſhip ſhe will forbid, and not ſuffer your ruine.</p>
            <p n="6">6. As I have heard her Majeſty to be a Prince of that magnanimity, that ſhe will ſpare the ſervice of the ableſt Subject or Peer, where ſhe ſhall be thought to ſtand in need of it; ſo ſhe is of that policie, as ſhe will not blaze the ſervice of a meaner then your Lordſhip, where it ſhall depend meerly upon her choice and will.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I held it for a principle, That thoſe diſeaſes are hardeſt to cure, whereof the cauſe is obſcure; and thoſe eaſieſt, whereof the cauſe is manifeſt. Whereupon I conclude, that ſince it hath been your errors in your lowneſs towards her Majeſty which have prejudiced you, that your reforming and conformity will reſtore you, ſo as you may be <hi>Faber fortunae propriae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, Conſidering your Lordſhip is removed from dealing in Cauſes of State, and left only to a place of Attendance, methinks the Ambition of any which can endure no Partners in State-matters may be ſo quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as they ſhould not laboriouſly oppoſe themſelves to your being in Court.

            <p> I Thank you for your kind and carefull letter; it perſwadeth that which <hi>I</hi> wiſh for ſtrongly, and hope for weakly, that is, poſſibility of reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to her Majeſties favour: Your arguments that would cheriſh hope, turn into diſpair: You ſay the Queen never meant to call me to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick cenſure, which ſheweth her goodneſs; but you ſee <hi>I</hi> paſſed it, which ſheweth others power. <hi>I</hi> believe moſt ſtedfaſtly, her Majeſty never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to bring my cauſe to a publick cenſure; and <hi>I</hi> believe as verily, that ſince the ſentence ſhe meant to reſtore me to tend upon her perſon: but thoſe which could uſe occaſions (which it was not in me to let) and amplifie and practiſe occaſions to repreſent to her Majeſty a neceſſity to bring me to the one, can and will do the like to ſtop me from the other. You ſay, my errors were my prejudice, and therefore <hi>I</hi> can mend my ſelf. It is true; but they that know that <hi>I</hi> can mend my ſelf, and that if <hi>I</hi> ever recover the Queen, that I will never loſe her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, will never ſuffer me to obtain intereſt in her favour: and you ſay, the Queen never forſook utterly where ſhe hath inwardly favoured; but know not whether the hour-glaſs of time hath altered her, but ſure I am, the falſe glaſſe of others informations muſt alter her, when <hi>I</hi> want acceſs to plead mine own cauſe, <hi>I</hi> know <hi>I</hi> ought doubly, infinitely to be her Majeſties both <hi>jure creationis,</hi> for <hi>I</hi> am her creature; and <hi>jure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptionis,</hi> for <hi>I</hi> know ſhe hath ſaved me from overthrow. But for her
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:125863:25"/>firſt love, and for her laſt protection, and all her great benefits, <hi>I</hi> can but pray for her Majeſty; &amp; my endevour is now to make my prayers for her and my ſelf better heard.

For your brother, I hold him an honeſt Gentleman, and wiſh him all good much rather for your ſake; your ſelf <hi>I</hi> know hath ſuffered more for me and with me, then any friend that <hi>I</hi> have: But <hi>I</hi> can but lament freely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as you ſee <hi>I</hi> do, and adviſe you not to do that <hi>I</hi> do, which is to deſpair. You know Letters what hurt they have done me, and therefore make ſure of this: and yet <hi>I</hi> could not, as having no other pledge of my love, but communicate openly with you for the eaſe of my heart and yours.</p>

            <p>MY duty humbly remembred to your Lordſhip: Having lately made diſpatches from <hi>Diep,</hi> and having made little way in <hi>France,</hi> by reaſon of Sir <hi>Thomas Wilks</hi> indiſpoſition, your Lordſhip can expect little from me; eſpecially having joyned with my aſſociates in a letter to your Lordſhip: Nevertheleſs, becauſe love and duty will find eaſily occaſion to expreſs themſelves, I am bold to yeild your Lordſhip ſome more trouble by my private Letter. I have met here with the primier Preſident of <hi>Roan,</hi> a man of great credit and reputation, one that untill meer neceſſity did force him, kept much hold here for this King: he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward retired, and kept the Parliament at <hi>Caen;</hi> he is learned, grave, of good perſon, good diſcourſe, &amp; well affectionate to <hi>England,</hi> his name is <hi>Claude Grollart;</hi> he is now next the Duke <hi>Monpencier,</hi> the ſtay of all thoſe quarters, inſomuch that when the King will be merry with him, he calls him one of the petty Dukes in <hi>Normandy:</hi> he did viſit me with great reſpect, and fell into familiar diſcourſe with me of your Lordſhip, whom he had known in <hi>England</hi> many years ſince, and hath had corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency with your Lordſhip by letters in Mr. Secretary <hi>Walſinghams</hi> time: And being talking thereof, he deſired me to tell your Lordſhip by occaſion, that when theſe troubles were like to grow by the League, you writ him a letter of advice to ſtick faſt to the King, and not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full though he ſaw difficulties; for you did hold it for a true Oracle, That the Kings on earth are like the Sun, and that ſuch as do ſeek to uſurp are like falling Starres: For the Sun, although it be ecclipſed and obfuſcated with miſts and clouds, at length they are diſperſed, where the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:125863:26"/>other are but figures of ſtars in the eyes view, and prove no more but exhalations, which ſuddenly diſſolve and fall to the earth, where they are conſumed. Becauſe I have little elſe to fill my paper, I preſume to trouble your Lordſhip thus far, to whom I think it cannot be offenſive to hear that for your ſake I am by many the better uſed, and that by your own wiſdom you are by men of place and gravity both honored and remembred. The marriage of the Duke of <hi>Tremouille</hi> to the Count <hi>Maurice</hi> his ſiſter, hath drawn the Duke of <hi>Bovillon</hi> towards <hi>Britany,</hi> where I am informed by this Preſident, that he meaneth to ſtay, and to attend the King, to whom he will clear himſelf if he take any knowledge of any jealouſie; and the rather becauſe he is there well fortified in a Countrey full of thoſe that are of the religion. It ſhall behove me being there to cary my ſelf tenderly towards him. The Kings proſperity in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany,</hi> hath already made his Catholikes begin to quarrel with the Accord which hath been made at the Aſſembly: For the perſons that were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to frame the Articles into an Edict, have varied upon ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall points, onely to trifle out the time, thereby to diſcover whether the King may need their aſſiſtance or no. But the Duke of <hi>Bovillon</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring inckling of it, made more haſte, and hath been with the King and doth return forthwith to him as ſoon as he hath been at the marriage of the Lady <hi>Tremoville.</hi> Your Lordſhip knows the circumſtances of my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney are not ſuch as can afford me any means to judge; but this your Lordſhip may aſſure, that by that time I have ſpoken to the King, things will break out one way other ſo far as it will appear whether it be worth the tarrying to treat or no; after once the King has been dealt with, to which I will addreſs my ſelf with all ſpeed, and not tarry for the States, who may be come to <hi>Paris</hi> by that time I do return: for I believe they will be content to treat any where. I ſhall have a miſs of Sir <hi>Thomas Wilks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> were it not we were well inſtructed; and ſurely, he was grown very heavy of late, and dull: If I ſhould ſtay here to attend his recovery, it would comſume me to no purpoſe. <hi>I</hi> have written a Letter to the Queen of ſome ſuch gathering as I have gotten, and of the ſpeeches between me and the Preſident, becauſe her Majeſty may not be offended that I write not particularly to her ſelfe of ſomething. Although the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from <hi>Callis</hi> have ſpoyled <hi>Baſe-Bologne,</hi> yet it is not holden here that the Cardinall will ſit down before any Town ſpeedily, for he will not be able. Nevertheleſſe the Conſtable is come into <hi>Picardy,</hi> to give ſtay to the Province; if that be the fruit of the Treaty, we ſhall have leſs need to diſſwade the King.</p>

            <p> WHereas you deſire to be advertiſed touching the proceedings here in Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, becauſe you ſeem to note in them ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie and variation, as if we ſomtimes inclined to one ſide, ſomtimes to another, and as if that clemencie and lenity were not uſed of late, that was uſed in the beginning; all which you impute to your own ſuperficial underſtanding of the affairs of this State, having notwithſtanding her Majeſties doing in ſingular reverence, as the real pledges which ſhe hath given unto the world of her ſincerity in Religion, and of her wiſdom in Government well meriteth: I am glad of this occaſion to impart that little I know in that matter to you, both for your own ſatisfaction, and to the end you may make uſe thereof towards any that ſhall not be ſo modeſtly and ſo reaſonably minded as you are. I find therefore her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties proceedings to have been grounded upon two principles.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The one, That conſciences are not to forced, but to be won and reduced by the force of truth, with the aid of time and the uſe of all good means of inſtruction and perſwaſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other, That the Cauſes of Conſcience wherein they exceed their bounds, and grow to be matter of faction, loſe their nature; and that Soveraign Prince ought diſtinctly to puniſh the practice in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, though coloured with the pretence of Conſcience and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:125863:27"/>
            <p>According to theſe principles, her Majeſty at her coming to the Crown, utterly diſliking the tyranny of <hi>Rome,</hi> which had uſed by terror and rigor to ſettle commandments of mens faiths and conſciences, though as a Prince of great wiſdom and magnanimity ſhe ſuffered but the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of one Religion, yet her proceedings towards the Papiſts was with great lenity, expecting the good effects which time might work in them: And therefore her Majeſty revived not the Laws made in the 28. and 35. of her Fathers reign, whereby the Oath of Supremacie might have been offered at the Kings pleaſure to any Subject, though he kept his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence never ſo modeſtly to himſelf; and the refuſal to take the ſame oath without further circumſtance was made Treaſon. But contrariwiſe her Majeſty not liking to make windows into mens hearts &amp; ſecret thoughts, except the abundance of them did overflow into overt and expreſs acts or affirmations, tempered her Laws ſo as it reſtraineth every manifeſt diſobedience in impugning and impeaching adviſedly and maliciouſly her Majeſties ſupreme power, maintaining and extolling a foraign juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And as for the Oath, it was altered by her Majeſty into a more gratefull form, the hardneſs of the name and appellation of <hi>Supreme Head</hi> was removed, and the penalty of the refuſal thereof turned only into diſablement to take any promotion, or to exerciſe any charge, and yet with liberty of being reinveſted therein if any man ſhould accept thereof during his life. But after when <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> had excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated her Majeſty, and the Bulls of Excommunication were publiſhed in <hi>London,</hi> whereby her Majeſty was in a ſort proſcribed; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon as upon a principal motive or preparative followed the Rebellion in the North: yet becauſe the ill humours of the Realm were by that Rebellion partly purged, and that ſhe feared at that time no foreign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion, and much leſs the attempt of any within the Realm not backed by ſome potent ſuccour from without, ſhe contented herſelf to make a Law againſt that ſpecial caſe of bringing and publiſhing of any Bulls or the like Inſtruments, whereunto was added a prohibition upon pain not of treaſon, but of an inferior degree of puniſhment againſt the bringing in of <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> hallowed bread, and ſuch other merchandiſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> as are well known not to be any eſſential part of the Romiſh religion, but only to be uſed in practiſe as Love-tokens to inchant the peoples affections from their allegiance to their natural Soveraign. In all other points her Majeſty continued her former lenity: but when about the 20. year of her reign ſhe had diſcovered in the King of <hi>Spain</hi> an intention to invade her Dominions, and that a principal point of the plot was to prepare a party within the Realm that might adhere to the Foreigner; and that the Seminaries began to bloſſom and to ſend forth daily Prieſts
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:125863:28"/>and profeſſed men, who ſhould by vow taken at Shrift reconcile her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from their obedience, yea &amp; bind many of them to attempt againſt her Majeſties ſacred perſon; and that by the poyſon which they ſpread, the humours of moſt Papiſts were altered, and that they were no more Papiſts in conſcience and of ſoftneſs, but Papiſts in faction; then were there new Laws made for the puniſhment of ſuch as ſhould ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſuch reconcilements or renunciations of obedience. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a Treaſon carried in the clouds, and in wonderfull ſecreſie, and came ſeldom to light, and that there was no preſuſpition thereof ſo great as the Recuſants to come to Divine Service, becauſe it was ſet down by their Decrees, that to come to Church before reconcilement was abſolutely heretical and damnable: Therefore there were added Laws containing puniſhment pecuniary againſt ſuch Recuſants, not to enforce Conſcience, but to enfeeble and impoveriſh the means of thoſe of whom it reſteth indifferent and ambiguous whether they were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled or no. And when notwithſtanding all this proviſion this poyſon was diſperſed ſo ſecretly, as that there was no means to ſtay it but by reſtraining the Merchants that brought it in; then laſtly there was added another Law, whereby ſuch ſeditious Prieſts of new erection were exiled, and thoſe that were at that time within the Land ſhipped over, and ſo commanded to keep hence upon pain of Treaſon.</p>
            <p>This hath been the proceeding, though intermingled not only with ſundry examples of her Majeſties grace towards ſuch as in her wiſdom ſhe knew to be Papiſts in conſcience, and not in faction and ſingularity, but alſo with an ordinary mitigation towards the offenders in the higheſt degree committed by Law, if they would but proteſt that in caſe this Realm ſhould be invaded with a foreign Army by the Popes authority for the Catholique cauſe, as they term it, they would take party with her Majeſty, and not adhere to her enemies. For the other part which have been offenſive to this State, though in other degree, which named them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Reformers, and we commonly call Puritans, this hath been the proceeding towards them a great while: When they inveighed againſt ſuch abuſes in the Church, as Pluralities, Non-reſidence, and the like; their zeal was not condemned, only their violence was ſometimes cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured: When they refuſed the uſe of ſome Ceremonies and Rites as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, they were tolerated with much connivencie and gentleneſs; yea when they called in queſtion the Superiority of Biſhops, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to bring a Democracie into the Church, yet their Propoſitions were heard, conſidered, and by contrary writings debated and diſcuſſed. Yet all this while it was perceived that their courſe was dangerous and very popular: As becauſe Papiſtry was odious, therefore it was ever in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:125863:28"/>their mouths, that they ſought to purge the Church from the reliques of Popery, a thing acceptable to the People, who love ever to run from one extreme to another. Becauſe multitudes of Rogues, and Poverty were an eye-ſore and diſlike to every man, therefore they put it into the Peoples head, that if Diſcipline were plaintive, there ſhould be no Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers nor Vagabonds; a thing very plauſible. And in like manner they promiſe the people many other impoſſible wonders of their Diſcipline. Beſides they opened the People a way to Government by their Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry &amp; Presbytery, a thing though in conſequence no leſs prejudicial to the liberties of private men then to the ſoveraignty of Princes, yet in the firſt ſhew very popular. Nevertheleſs this (except it were in ſome few that entred into extreme contempt) was borne with, becauſe they pretended but in dutifull manner to make Propoſitions, and to leave it to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, and the authority of the Magiſtrate. But now of late years, when there iſſued from them a Colony of thoſe that affirmed the conſent of the Magiſtrate was not to be attended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when under pretence of a Confeſſion to avoid ſlanders and imputations, they combined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Claſſes and Subſcriptions; when they deſcended into that vile and baſe means of defacing the Government of the Church by ridiculous Paſquils; when they began to make many Subjects in doubt to take an Oath, which is one of the fundamental points of Juſtice in this Land and in all places; when they began both to vaunt of their ſtrength and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their partizans and followers, and to uſe the communications that their Cauſe would prevail, though with uprore and violence; then it appeared to be no more zeal, no more conſcience, but meer faction and diviſion: And therefore though the State were compelled to hold ſomwhat a harder hand to reſtrain them then before, yet it was with as great moderation as the peace of the Church and State could permit. And therefore to conclude, conſider uprightly of theſe matters, and you ſhall ſee her Majeſty is no Temporizer in Religion. It is not the ſucceſs abroad, nor the change of ſervants here at home can alter her; only as the things themſelves alter, ſo ſhe applied her religious wiſdom to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond unto them, ſtill retaining the two rules before mentioned in dealing tenderly with conſciences, and yet in diſcovering Faction from Conſcience.

The transferring this honour upon your ſelf conſiſteth in two points: The one, if the principal, perſons imployed come in by you, and depend upon you; the other, if your Lordſhip declare your ſelf to undertake a care of that matter. For the perſons, it falleth out well, that your Lordſhip hath had no intereſt in the perſons of imputation: For neither Sir <hi>William Fitz-Williams,</hi> nor Sir <hi>John Norris</hi> was yours: Sir <hi>William Ruſſel</hi> was conceived yours, but was curbed: Sir <hi>Coniers Clifford,</hi> as I conceive it, dependeth upon you, who is ſaid to do well; and if my Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> in this interim do accommodate well, I take it he hath always had good underſtanding with your Lordſhip. So as all things are not only whole and entire, but of favourable aſpect towards your Lordſhip, if you now chuſe well: wherein in your wiſdom you will remember there is a great difference in choice of the perſons, as you ſhall think the affairs to incline to compoſition or to war. For your care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, popular conceit hath been, that <hi>Iriſh</hi> cauſes have been much neglected, whereby the very reputation of better care will be a ſtrength: And I am ſure her Majeſty and my Lords of the Councel do not think their care diſſolved, when they have choſen whom to imploy; but that they will proceed in a ſpirit of State, and not leave the main point to diſcretion. Then if a Reſolution be taken, a Conſultation muſt proceed; and the Conſultation muſt be governed upon Information to be had from ſuch as know the place and matters in fact: And in taking of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I have always noted there is a skill and a wiſdom. For I cannot tell
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:125863:29"/>what accompt or inquiry hath been taken of Sir <hi>William Ruſſel,</hi> of Sir <hi>Ralph Bingham,</hi> of the Earl of <hi>Tomond,</hi> of Mr. <hi>Wilbraham:</hi> but I am of opinion much more would be had of them, if your Lordſhip ſhall be pleaſed ſeverally to confer, not <hi>obiter,</hi> but expreſly upon ſome <hi>Caveat</hi> given them to think of it before; for, <hi>bene docet qui prudenter interrogat.</hi> For the points of oppoſing them, I am too much a ſtranger to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to deduce them: but in a —Topique methinks the pertinent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations muſt be either of the poſſibility and means of Accord, or of the nature of the War, or of the reformation of the particular abuſes, or of the joyning of practice with force in the diſunion of the Rebels. If your Lordſhip doubt to put your ſickle in others mens harveſts, yet conſider you have theſe advantages. Firſt, Time being fit to you in Mr. Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries abſence: Next, <hi>Vis unita fortior:</hi> Thirdly, the buſineſs being mixt with matters of war, it is fitteſt for you: Laſtly, I know your Lordſhip will carry it with that modeſty and reſpect towards aged Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and that good correſpondencie towards my dear Ally and your good friend now abroad, as no inconveniencie may grow that way. Thus have I plaid the ignorant Stateſman, which I do to no body but your Lordſhip, except I do it to the Queen ſometimes when ſhe trains me on. But your Lordſhip will accept my duty and good meaning, and ſecure me touching the privateneſs of that I write.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THoſe advertiſements which your Lordſhip imparted to me, and the like, I hold to be no more certain to make judgment upon, then a Patients water to a Phyſitian: Therefore for me upon one water to make a judgment, were indeed like a fooliſh bold Mountebank or Doctor <hi>Birket.</hi> Yet for willing duties ſake, I will ſet down to your Lordſhip what opinion ſprung in my mind upon that I read. The Letter from the Councel there leaning to diſtruſt, I do not much rely upon for three cauſes. Firſt, becauſe it is always both the grace, and the ſafety from blame of ſuch a Councel, to erre in caution: whereunto add, that it may be they or ſome of them are not without envy towards the perſon who
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:125863:30"/>is uſed in treating the Accord. Next, becauſe the time of this Treaty hath no ſhew of diſſimulation, for that <hi>Tyrone</hi> is now in no ſtrai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, but like a Gameſter that will give over becauſe he is a winner, not becauſe he hath no more mony in his purſe.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I do not ſee but thoſe Articles whereupon they ground their ſuſpition, may as well proceed out of fear as out of falſhood for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining of the dependance of the protracting the admiſsion of a Sheriffe, the refuſing to give his ſon for hoſtage, the holding from preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to <hi>Dublin,</hi> the refuſing to go preſently to accord without including <hi>O Donell</hi> and others his aſſociates, may very well come of a guilty reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in caſe he ſhould receive hard meaſure, and not out of treachery, ſo as if the great perſon be faithfull, and that you have not here ſome preſent intelligence of preſent ſuccours from <hi>Spain,</hi> for the expectation whereof <hi>Tyrone</hi> would win time. I ſee no deep cauſe of diſtruſting the cauſe if it be good. And for the queſtion, her Majeſty ſeemeth to me a winner three ways: Firſt, her purſe ſhall have reſt: Next, it will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the foreign deſignes upon that place. Thirdly, though her Majeſty is like for a time to govern <hi>Precario</hi> in the North, and be not in true command in better ſtate there then before, yet beſides the two reſpects of eaſe of charge, and advantage of opinion abroad before mentioned, ſhe ſhall have a time to uſe her Princely policy in two points: In the one to weaken by diviſion and diſunion of the heads; the other by recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and winning the people by juſtice, which of all other cauſes is the beſt. Now for the <hi>Athenian</hi> queſtion you diſcourſe well, <hi>Quid igitur agendum eſt,</hi> I will ſhoot my fools bolt, ſince you will have it ſo. The Earle of <hi>Ormond</hi> to be encouraged and comforted above all things, the Garriſons to be inſtantly provided for: For opportunity makes a thief, and if he ſhould mean never ſo well now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet ſuch an advantage as the breaking of her Majeſties Garriſons, might tempt a true man. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he may as well waver upon his own inconſtancy as upon occaſion, and wont of variableneſs is never reſtrained but with fear, I hold it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary he be menaced with a ſtrong war, not by words, but by Muſters and preparations of forces here, in caſe the Accord proceed not; but none to be ſent over leſt it diſturb the Treaty, and make him look to be over-run as ſoon as he hath laid down Arms. And but that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is too eaſie to paſſe in ſuch caſes from diſsimulation to verity, I think if your Lordſhip lent your reputation in this caſe, it is to pretend that if not a defenſive war as in times paſt, but a full reconqueſt of thoſe parts of the Count<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </opener>
            <p>your note of my ſilence in your occaſions hath made me ſet down theſe few wandring lines, as one that would ſay ſomwhat and can ſay nothing touching your Lordſhips inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded charge for <hi>Ireland;</hi> which my endeavour I know your Lordſhip will accept graciouſly and well, whether your Lordſhip take it by the handle of th'occaſion miniſtred from your ſelf, or of th'affection from which it proceedeth, your Lordſhip is deſigned to a ſervice of great merit and great perill; and as the greatneſs of the peril muſt needs include no ſmall conſequence of perill if it be not temperately go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned: for all immoderate ſucceſſe extinguiſheth merit, and ſeareth up diſtaſte and envy, the aſſured fore-runner of whole changes of peril. But I am at the laſt point firſt, ſome good ſpirit leading my pen to preſage to your Lordſhips ſucceſs: wherein it is true, I am not without my Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and Divinations, none of them ſuperſtitious, and yet not all naturall: For firſt, looking into the courſe of Gods providence in things now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, and calling into conſideration how great things God hath done by her Majeſty, and for her collect he hath diſpoſed of this great diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whereby to give an urgent occaſion to the reduction of that whole kingdom, as upon the rebellion of <hi>Deſmond</hi> there enſued the reduction of that Province. Next, your Lordſhip goeth againſt three
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:125863:31"/>of the unluckieſt vices of all other, Diſloyalty, Ingratitude, &amp; Inſoſolence: which three offences in all examples have ſeldome their doom adjourned to the world to come. Laſtly, he that ſhall have had the honor to know your Lordſhip inwardly, as I have had, ſhall find <hi>bona extra,</hi> whereby he may better ground a divination of good, then upon the diffection of a Sacrifice. But that part I leave; for it is fit for others to be confident upon you, &amp; you to be confident upon the cauſe; the goodneſſe &amp; juſtice whereof is ſuch, as can hardly be matched in any example, it being no ambitious war of Foreigns, but a recovery of ſubjects, and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lenity of conditions often tried; and a recovery of them not onely to obedience, but to humanity and policy from more then <hi>Indian Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm.</hi> There is yet another kind of divination familiar in matters of State, being that which <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> ſo often relieth upon in his time, where he ſaith, That which for the time paſt is worſt of all, is for the time to come the beſt, which is, that things go ill, not by accident, but by error; wherein if your Lordſhip have been a waking Cenſor, but muſt look for no other now but <hi>Medice cura teipſum:</hi> And although your Lordſhip ſhal not be the bleſſed Phyſician that cometh to the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the diſeaſe, yet you imbrace that condition which many No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spirits have accepted for advantage, which is, that you go upon the greater perill of your fortune, and the leſs of your reputation; and ſo the honor countervaileth the adventure: of which honor your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is in no ſmall poſſeſsion, when that her Majeſty known to be one of the moſt judicious Princes in diſcerning of ſpirits, that ever governed, hath made choyce of you meerly out of her Royall judgement (her affection inclining rather to continue your attendance) into whoſe hands &amp; truſt to put the commandement &amp; conduct of ſo great forces, the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering in the fruit of ſo great charge, the execution of ſo many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, the redeeming of the defaults of ſo many former Governors, and the clearing of the glory of ſo many happy years reign onely in this part excepted. Nay further, how far forth the perill of that State is interla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with the perill of <hi>England;</hi> and therefore how great the honor is to keep and defend the approaches of this kingdom, I hear many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and indeed there is a great difference whether the <hi>Tortoiſe</hi> gather her ſelfe into her ſhell hurt or unhurt: And if any man be of opinion, that the nature of an enemy doth extenuate the honour of a ſervice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a Rebell and a Savage, I differ from him; for I ſee the juſteſt Triumphs that the <hi>Romans</hi> in their greateſt greatneſs did obtain, and that whereof the Emperours in their ſtiles took additions and denominations, were of ſuch an enemy, that is, people barbarous and not reduced to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, magnifying a kind of lawleſs liberty, prodigall of life, hardned
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:125863:31"/>in body, fortified in woods and bogs, placing both juſtice and felicity in the ſharpneſs to their ſwords. Such were the <hi>Germans</hi> and antient <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> and divers others. Upon which kind of people whether the victory be a Conqueſt, or a Reconqueſt upon a rebellion or revolt, it made no difference that ever I could find in honour. And therefore it is not the inriching predatory war that hath the preheminence in honour; elſe ſhould it be more honour to bring in a Carrock of rich burthen, then one of the twelve Spaniſh Apoſtles. But then this nature of people doth yield a higher point of honour (conſidering in truth and ſubſtance) then any war can yield which ſhould be atchieved againſt a civil enemy, if the end may be <hi>Paci<expan>

            <p>Now although it be true, that theſe things which I have writ (being but repreſentations unto your Lordſhip of the honour and apparance of ſucceſs of the enterpriſe) be not much to the purpoſe of my direction, yet it is that which is beſt to me being no man of war, and ignorant in the particulars of Eſtate: for a man may by the eye ſet up the white right in the midſt of the But, though he be no Archer. Therefore I will only add this wiſh, according to the Engliſh phraſe, which termeth a wel-willing advice a wiſh, That your Lordſhip in this whole action look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward ſet down this Poſition, That merit is worthier then fame; and looking back hither would remember this text, That obedience is better then ſacrifice. For deſigning to fame and glory, may make your Lordſhip in the adventure of your perſon to be valiant as a private Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier rather then as a Generall; it may make you in your commandments rather to be gracious then diſciplinary; it may make you preſs action in the reſpect of the great expectation conceived, rather haſtily then ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably and ſafely; it may make you ſeek rather to atchieve the war by force, then by intermixture of practice; it may make you (if God ſhall ſend you proſperous beginnings) rather ſeek the fruition, of that honour then the perfection of the work in hand And for your proceeding like a good Proteſtant (upon warrant, and not upon good intention) your Lordſhip knoweth in your wiſdom, that as it is moſt fit for you to deſire convenient liberty of inſtruction, ſo it is no leſs fit for you to obſerve the due limits of them, remembring that the exceeding of them may not
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:125863:32"/>only procure (in caſe of adverſe accident) a dangerous diſadvow, but alſo (in caſe of proſperous ſucceſs) be ſubject to interpretation, as if all were not referred to the right end.</p>
            <p>Thus I have preſumed to write theſe few lines to your Lordſhip <hi>in methodo ignorantiae,</hi> which is, when a man ſpeaketh of any ſubject not according to the parts of the matter, but according to the model of his own knowledge.

But of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points (to my underſtanding) the moſt effectuall is, the well expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or impreſſing of the deſign of this State, upon that miſerable and deſolate kingdom, containing the ſame between theſe two liſts or boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries: the one, that the Queen ſeeketh not an extirpation of the people, but a reduction; and now that ſhe hath chaſtiſed them by Royall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Arms, according to the neceſſity of the occaſion, her Majeſty ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no pleaſure in effuſion of blood, or diſplanting of ancient genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the other, that her Majeſties Princely care is principally and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally bent upon that action of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that ſhe ſeeketh not ſo much the eaſe of charge, as the Royall performance of her Office of Protection, and reclaim of thoſe her Subjects: And in a word, that the caſe is allowed as far as may ſtand with the honor of the time paſt, which it is eaſie to reconcile, as in my laſt note I ſhewed. And again I do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat, that if her Majeſties deſign be <hi>ex profeſſo</hi> to reduce wild and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous people to civility and juſtice, as well as to reduce Rebels to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, it maketh weakneſs true Chriſtianity, and conditions turn graces, and ſo hath a fineneſs in turning utility upon point of honor or theſe times. And beſides, if her Majeſty ſhall ſuddenly abate the liſts of her Forces, and ſhall do nothing to countervail it in the point of reputation of a publick proceeding, I doubt things may too ſoon fall back into the ſtate they were in. Next to this, adding reputation to the cauſe by
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:125863:33"/>imprinting an opinion of her Majeſties care and intention upon this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the taking away the reputation from the contrary ſide, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the opinion and expectation of foreign ſuccours: to which purpoſe this enterpriſe of <hi>Algiers,</hi> if it hold according to the advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and if be not wrapped up in the period of this Summer, ſeemeth to be an opportunity <hi>Coelitus demiſſa.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more fit then a Treaty, or a ſhadow of Treaty of a Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> which methinks ſhould be in our power to faſten, at leaſt <hi>rumore tenus,</hi> to the deluding of as wiſe a people as the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> Laſtly, for this point that the Antients called <hi>poteſtas facta redeundi ad ſanitatem,</hi> and which is but a mockery when the Enemy is ſtrong or proud, but effectual in his declination; that is, a liberal Proclamation of grace and pardon to ſuch as ſhall ſubmit and come in within a time prefixed, and of ſome further reward to ſuch as ſhall bring others in, that our ſword may be ſharpned againſt anothers, as a matter of good experience; and now I think will come in time. And per caſe though I wiſh the excluſions of ſuch a Pardon exceeding few, yet it will not be ſafe to continue ſome of them in their ſtrength, but to tranſlate them and their generation into <hi>England,</hi> and give them recompence and ſatisfaction here for their poſſeſſions there, as the King of <hi>Spain</hi> did by divers families of <hi>Portugal.</hi> The effecting of all the which fall within the points aforeſaid, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thoſe which fall within the diviſions following: Nothing can be in priority either of time or matter precedent to the ſending of ſome Commiſſion of the continuance <hi>ad res inſpiciendas &amp; componendas.</hi> For it muſt be a very ſignificant demonſtration of her Majeſties care of that Kingdom, a credence to any that ſhall come in and ſubmit, a bridle to any that have their fortunes there, and ſhall apply their propoſitions to private ends, and an evidence of her Majeſties politique courſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out neglect or reſpiration; and it hath been the wiſdome of the beſt examples of Government. Towards the recovery of hearts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there be but three things in <hi>natura rerum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Religion. 2. Juſtice and Protection. 3. Obligation and reward. For Religion, to ſpeak firſt of Piety, and then of Policie. All Divines do agree, that if Conſciences be to be inforced at all whereby they differ, yet two things muſt precede their inforcement; th'one means of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, th'other time of operation: Neither of which they have yet had. Beſides till they be more like reaſonable men then they yet are, their ſociety were rather ſcandalous to true Religion then otherwiſe, as pearl caſt before ſwine: For till they be cleanſed from their blood, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continencie, and theft, and which are now not the lapſes of particular perſons, but the very laws of the Nation, they are incompatible with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:125863:34"/>Religion formed with Policie. There is no doubt but to wreſtle with them now, is directly oppoſite to their reclaim, and cannot but continue their alienation of mind from this government. Beſides, one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal pretences whereby the heads of the Rebellion have prevailed both with the people and the Foreigner, hath been the defence of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique religion; and it is that likewiſe hath made the Foreigner reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally more plauſible with the Rebel. Therefore a Toleration of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion for a time not definite, except it be in ſome principal Towns and Precincts, after the manner of ſome French Edicts, ſeemeth to me to be a matter warrantable by Religion, and in Policie of abſolute neceſſity; and the heſitation of this, I think, hath been a great caſting back of the affairs there. Neither if any Engliſh Papiſt or Recuſant ſhall for liberty of his conſcience transfer his perſon, family and fortunes thither, do I hold it a matter of danger, but expedient to draw on undertaking, and to further population. Neither if <hi>Rome</hi> will cozen it ſelf by conceiving it may be ſome degree to the like Toleration in <hi>England,</hi> do I hold it a matter of any moment, but rather a good mean to take off the fierceneſs and eagerneſs of the humour of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to ſtay further Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Interdictions of <hi>Ireland.</hi> But there would go hand in hand with this ſome courſe of advantage. Religion indeed, where the people is capable of it, is the ſending over of ſome good Preachers, eſpecially of that ſort which are vehement and zealous perſwaders, and not Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, to be reſident in the principal Towns, endowing them with ſome ſtipend out of her Majeſties revenues, as her Majeſty hath moſt religiouſly and graciouſly done in <hi>Lancaſhire;</hi> and the recontinuing and repleniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Colledge begun at <hi>Dublin,</hi> the placing of good men Biſhops in the Sea there; the taking care of the verſions of Bibles, Catechiſms, and other books of Inſtruction into the Iriſh language, and the like reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious courſes, both for the honour of God, and for the avoiding of ſcandal and inſatisfaction here, by a toleration of Religion there. For inſtance, the Barbariſm and deſolation of the Country conſidered, it is not poſſible they ſhould find any ſweetneſs at all of it, (which hath been the error of times paſt) formal and fetched far off from the State, becauſe it will require running up and down for proceſs of polling and exactions by fees, and many other delays and charges: And therefore there muſt be an interim in which the Juſtice muſt be only ſummary, the rather becauſe it is fit and ſafe for a time the Country do partioipate of Martial govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And therefore I do wiſh in every principal Town or place of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation there were a Captain or a Governour, and a Judge, ſuch as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corders and learned Stewards are here in Corporations, who may have a Prerogative-Commiſſion to hear and determine <hi>ſecundum ſanam di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretionem,</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:125863:34"/>and as neer as may be to the Laws and Cuſtoms of <hi>England,</hi> and that by Bill or Plaint without Original Writ, reſerving from their sentence matter of Freehold and Inheritance to be determined before a ſuperior Judge itinerant, to be reverſed if cauſe be, before the Councel of the Province to be eſtabliſhed with fit Informations.</p>
            <p>For obligation and reward, it is true no doubt which was anciently ſaid, That a State is contained in two words, <hi>Praemium &amp; Poena:</hi> And I am perſwaded, if a penny in the pound which hath been ſpent <hi>in poena,</hi> a chaſtiſement of Rebels, without other fruit or emolument of this State, had been ſpent <hi>in praemio,</hi> that in rewarding, things had never grown to this extremity. But to ſpeak forwards: The keeping of the principal Iriſh perſons in term of contentment, and without particular complaint, as generally the carrying of an eaven courſe between the Engliſh and the Iriſh, whether it be in competition, or whether it be in controverſie, as if they were one Nation, without the ſame partial courſe which hath been held by the Governours and Councellors, that ſome have favoured the Iriſh, and ſome contrary, is one of the beſt medicines for that State. And as for other points of governing their Nobility as well in this Court as there, of Knighthood, of Education of their Children, and the like points of comfort and allurement, they are things which fall into every mans conſideration.</p>
            <p>For the extirpating of the ſeeds of troubles, I ſuppoſe the main roots are but three: The firſt, the ambition and abſoluteneſs of the chief of the Families and Sects; the ſecond, the licentious idleneſs of their Kerns and Souldiers that lie upon their Country by ſeſſes and ſuch oppreſſions; the third, the barbarous cuſtoms in habits of apparel, in theſe Poets or Heralds that inchant them in ſavage manners, and ſundry other ſuch dregs of Barbariſm and Rebellion, which by a number of politique Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of <hi>Ireland</hi> meet to be put in execution are already forbidden, unto which ſuch additions may be made as the preſent time requireth. But the reducing of this branch requireth a more particular notice of the ſtate and manners there then falls within my compaſs.</p>
            <p>For Plantations and buildings, I do find it ſtrange, that in the laſt plot for the population of <hi>Munſter,</hi> there were limitations how much in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſnes, and how much in Farm and Tenantry, how many buildings ſhould be erected, how many <hi>Iriſh</hi> in mixture ſhould be admitted; but there was no reſtraint that they might not build <hi>ſparſim</hi> at their pleaſure, much leſs any condition that they ſhould make places fortified and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſible, the which was too much ſecureneſs to my underſtanding. So as for this laſt point of plantations and buildings, there be two conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which I hold moſt material; th'one of quickning, th'other for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:125863:35"/>aſſuring: The firſt is, that choyce be made of ſuch perſons for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Towns and places, and ſuch undertakers be procured as be men gracious and wel-beloved, and are like to be well followed; wherein for <hi>Munſter</hi> it may be, becauſe it is not <hi>Res integra,</hi> but that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer undertakers ſtand intereſſed there, will be ſome difficulty; but ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (in mine opinion) either with agreeing with them, or by over-ruling them by a Parliament in <hi>Ireland</hi> (which in this courſe of a politique pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, infinite occaſions will require ſpeedily to be held) it will be fit to ſupply fit qualified perſons for underakers. The other, that it be not left as heretofore, to the pleaſure of the undertakers and adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, where and how to build and plant, but that they do it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a preſcript or formality. For firſt, the places both Maritine and Inland, which are fitteſt for Colonies or Garriſon, as well for doubt of Foreigners, as for keeping the Countrey in bridle, would be found ſurveighed and reſolved upon; and then that the Patentees be tied to build thoſe places onely, and to fortifie as ſhall be thought convenient. And laſtly, it followeth of courſe in Countries of new populations, to invite and provoke inhabitants by ample liberties and Charters.</p>

I am one that know both mine own wants and other mens, and it may be perchance that mine may mend when others ſtand at a ſtay: And ſurely I may not in publike place endure to be wronged, without repelling the ſame to my beſt advantage to right myſelf. You are great, and therefore have the more enviers, which would be glad to have you paid at anothers coſt. Since the time I miſſed the Sollicitors place, the rather I think by your means, I cannot expect that you and I ſhall ever ſerve as Attorney and Sollicitor; but either to ſerve with another upon your remove, or to ſtep into ſome other courſe. So as I am more free then ever I was from any occaſion of unworthy conforming my ſelf to you, more then generall good manners, or your particular good uſage ſhall provoke: And if you had not been ſhort-ſighted in your own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune (as I think) you might have had more uſe of me; but that tide is paſt. I write not this to ſhew any friends what a brave Letter I have writ to Mr. Attorney, I have none of thoſe humours: but that I have written is to a good end, that is, to the more decent carriage of my Maſters ſervice, and to our particular better underſtanding one another. This Letter, if it ſhall be anſwered by you in deed, and not in word, I ſuppoſe it will not be worſe for us both; elſe it is but a few lines loſt, which for a much ſmaller matter I would adventure: So this being to your ſelf, I for my part reſt</p>

            <p> THough it be true, that who conſidereth the wind and the rain; ſhall neither ſow nor reap, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.15. yet there is a ſeaſon for every action: And ſo there is a time to ſpeak, and a time to keep ſilence; there
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:125863:38"/>is a time when the words of a poor ſimple man may profit: and that poor man in the Preacher which delivered the City by his wiſdom, found, that without this opportunity, the power both of wiſdom and eloquence loſe but their labour, and cannot charm the deaf Adder. God therefore, before his Son that bringeth mercy, ſent his ſervant the Trumpeter of repentance to level a very high hill, to prepare the way before him, making it ſmooth and ſtreight. And as it is in ſpiritual things, where Chriſt never comes before his Way-maker hath laid even the heart with ſorrow and repentance, ſince ſelf-conceited and proud per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons think themſelves too good and too wiſe to learn of their inferior, and therefore need not the Phyſitian: ſo in the rules of earthly wiſdom it is not poſſible for nature to attain any mediocrity of perfection, before ſhe be humbled by knowing her ſelf and her own ignorance. Not only knowledge, but alſo every other gift (which we call the gifts of fortune) have power to pull up earthly — Afflictions only level theſe Mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hils of pride, plough the heart, and make it fit for Wiſdom to ſow her ſeed, and for Grace to bring forth her increaſe. Happy is that man therefore both in regard of heavenly and earthly wiſdom, that is thus wounded, to be cured; thus broken, to be made ſtraight; thus made acquainted with his own imperfections, that he may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing this to be the time of your affliction, that which I have propounded to my ſelf is, by taking this ſeaſonable advantage, like a true friend (though far unworthy to be counted ſo) to ſhew you your true ſhape in a glaſs, and that not in a falſe one to flatter you, nor yet in one that ſhould make you ſeem worſe then you are, and ſo offend you, but in one made by the reflexion of your own words and actions, from whoſe light proceeds the voice of the people, which is often not unfitly called the voice of God: but therein (ſince I purpoſed a truth) I muſt intreat liberty to be plain, a liberty that at this time I know not whether or no I may uſe ſafely, I am ſure at other times I could not: yet of this reſolve your ſelf, it proceedeth from love, and a true deſire to do you good, that you knowing the generall opinion, may not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neglect or contemn it, but mend what you find amiſs in yourſelf, and tain what your judgment ſhall approve; for to this end ſhall truth be delivered as naked as if your ſelf were to be anatomized by the hand of opinion. All men can ſee their own profit, that part of the wallet hangs before. A true friend (whoſe worthy office I would perform, ſince I fear both your ſelf and all great men want ſuch, being themſelves true friends to few or none) is firſt to ſhew the other, and which is from your eyes.</p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:125863:39"/>
            <p>Firſt therefore behold your errors: In diſcourſe you delight to ſpeak too much, not to hear other men; this ſome ſay becomes a pleader, not a Judge: for by this ſometimes your affections are intangled with a love of your own arguments though they be the weaker, and rejecting of thoſe which when your affections were ſetled, your own judgment would allow for ſtrongeſt. Thus while you ſpeak in your own Element, the Law, no man ordinarily equals you; but when you wander, (as you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten delight to do) you then wander indeed, and give never ſuch ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as the curious time requires. This is not cauſed by any naturall defect, but firſt for want of election, when you having a large and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mind, ſhould not ſo much labour what to ſpeak, as to find what to leave unſpoken; rich ſoils are often to be weeded.</p>
            <p>Secondly, you cloy your auditory when you would be obſerved, ſpeech muſt either be ſweet or ſhort.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, you converſe with Books, not men, and Books ſpecially hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and have no excellent choyce with men, who are the beſt Books: for a man of action and imployment you ſeldome converſe with, and then but with your underlings, not freely, but as a Schoolmaſter with his Scholars, ever to teach, never to learn. But if ſomtimes you would in your familiar diſcourſe hear others, and make election of ſuch as know what they ſpeak, you ſhould know many of theſe tales you tell to be but ordinary, and many other things which you delight to repeat and ſerve in for novelties, to be but ſtale. As in your pleadings you were wont to inſult over miſery, and to inveigh bitterly at the perſons (which bred you many enemies whoſe poyſon yet ſwelleth, and the effects now appear) ſo are you ſtill wont to be a little careleſs in this point to praiſe or diſgrace upon ſlight grounds, and that ſometimes untruly, ſo that your reproofs or commendations are for the moſt part neglected and contemned; when the cenſure of a Judge (coming ſlow, but ſure) ſhould be a brand to the guilty, and a crown to the vertuous. You will jeſt at any man in publique, without reſpect of the perſons dignity or your own. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceth your gravity more then it can advance the opinion of your wit, and ſo do all actions which we ſee you do directly with a touch of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, having no reſpect to the true end. You make the Law to lean too much to your opinion, whereby you ſhew your ſelf to be a legall Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, ſtriking with tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> weapon where you pleaſe, ſince you are able to turn the edge any way. For thus the wiſe Maſter of the Law gives warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to young Students, that they ſhould be wary leſt while they hope to be inſtructed by your integrity and knowledge, they ſhould be deceived with your skill armed with authority. Your too much love of the world is too much ſeen, when having the living of 10000l. you relieve few
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:125863:39"/>or none. The hand that hath taken ſo much, can it give ſo little? Herein you ſhew no bowels of compaſſion, as if you thought all too little for your ſelf; or that God had given you all that you have (if you think wealth to be his gift, I mean that you get well, for I know ſure the reſt is not) only to that end you ſhould ſtill gather more, and never be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, but try how much you could gather to accompt for all at the great and generall Audit-day. We deſire you to amend this, and let your poor Tenants in <hi>Norfolk</hi> find ſome comfort, where nothing of your eſtate is ſpent towards their relief, but all brought up hither to the impoveriſhing of your Country.</p>
            <p>In your laſt, which might have been your beſt peece of ſervice to the State, affectioned to follow that old rule which giveth Juſtice leaden heels and iron hands, you uſed too many delayes, till the Delinquents hands were looſed, and yours bound. In that work you ſeemed another <hi>Fabius,</hi> here the humour of <hi>Marcellus</hi> would have done better: What needed you have ſought more evidences then enough? While you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the finding out of more, (miſſing your aim) you diſcredited what you had found. This beſt Judgments think, though you never uſed ſuch ſpeeches as are fathered upon you, yet you might well have done it, and but rightly: For this crime was ſecond to none but the Powder-plot: That would have blown up all at one blow, a mercifull cruelty; this would have done the ſame by degrees, a lingring, but a ſure way; one might by one be called out, till all oppoſers had been removed. Beſides, that other Plot was ſcandalous to <hi>Rome,</hi> making Popery odious in the ſight of the whole world: This hath been ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to the truth of the whole Goſpel, and ſince the firſt nullity to this inſtant, when Juſtice hath her hands bound, the Devil could not have invented a more miſchievous practice to our State and Church then this hath been, is, and is like to be. God avert the evil.</p>
            <p>But herein you committed another fault, that you were too open in your proceedings, and ſo taught them whereby to defend themſelves; ſo you gave them time to undermine Juſtice, and to work upon all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages both of affections and honor, and opportunity, and breach of friendſhip: which they have ſo wel followed, ſparing neither pains nor coſt, that it almoſt ſeemeth an offence in you to have done ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, then that you have done no more: you ſtopt the confeſſions &amp; accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of ſome, who perhaps had they been ſuffered, would have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken enough to have removed ſome ſtumbling-blocks out of your way: and that you did not this in the favour of any one, but of I know not what preſent unadviſed humours, ſuppoſing enough behind to diſcover all, which fel not out ſo. Howſoever, as the Apoſtle ſaith in another caſe,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:125863:40"/>you went not rightly to the truth, and therefore though you were to be commended for what you did, yet you were to be reprehended for many circumſtances in the doing; and doubtleſs God hath an eye in this croſs to your negligence, and the briers are left to be pricks in your ſides, and thorns in your eyes. But that which we commend you for, are thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent parts of Nature, and knowledge in the Law, which you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued withall; but theſe are only good in their good uſe: wherefore we thank you heartily for ſtanding ſtoutly in the Commonwealths behalfe, hoping it proceedeth not from a diſpoſition to oppoſe Greatneſs (as your enemies ſay) but to do juſtice, and deliver truth indifferently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect of perſons; and in this we pray for your proſperity, and are ſorry that your good actions ſhould not always ſucceed happily. But in the carriage of this you were faulty, for you took it in hand in an evill time, both in reſpect of the preſent buſineſs which it interrupted, and in regard of his preſent ſickneſs whom it concerned, whereby you diſuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted your ſtrength, and made a gap for the enemies to paſs out at, and to return and aſſault you.</p>
            <p>But now, ſince the caſe ſo ſtandeth, we deſire you to give way to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſo to fight that you be not utterly broken, but reſerved intirely to ſerve the Commonwealth again, and do what good you can, ſince you cannot do all the good you would; and ſince you are fallen upon this rock, caſt out the goods to ſave the bottom, ſtop the leaks and make towards land, learn of the Steward to make friends of the unrighteous Mammon. Thoſe <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Mexico</hi> who were chaſed of the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> tell us what to do with our goods in our extremities, they being to paſſe over a river in their flight, as many as caſt away their gold ſwam over ſafe; but ſome more covetous, keeping their gold, were either drowned with it, or overtaken and ſlain by the Savages: you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived now learn to give. The <hi>Beaver</hi> learns us this leſſon, who being hunted for his ſtones, bites them off: You cannot but have much of your eſtate (pardon my plainneſſe) ill got, think how much of that you never ſpake for, how much by ſpeaking unjuſtly or in unjuſt cauſes. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it then a bleſſing of God if thus it may be laid out for your good, and not left for your heir to haſten the waſting of much of the reſt, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of all; for ſo we ſee God oftentimes proceeds in judgement with many haſty gatherers: you have enough to ſpare, being well laid, to turn the Tide, and fetch all things again. But if you eſcape (I ſuppoſe it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of an <hi>if</hi>) ſince you know the old uſe, that none called in queſtion muſt go away uncenſured; yet conſider that accuſations make wounds, and leave ſcarres; and though you ſee your tale behind your back, your ſelf free, and the Covert before, yet remember there are ſtands, truſt not a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:125863:40"/>reconciled enemies, but think the peace is but to ſecure you for further advantage, expect a ſecond and a third encounter, the main battell, the wings are yet unbroken, they may charge you at an inſtant, or death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: walk therefore circumſpectly; and if at length by means of our good endeavours and yours, you recover the favour that you have loſt, give God the glory in action, not in words onely, and remember us with ſenſe of your paſt misfortune, whoſe eſtate hath, doth, and may hereafter lye in the power of your breath. There is a great mercy in diſpatch, delays are tortures wherewith we are by degrees rent out of our eſtates: do not you (if you be reſtored) as ſome others do, fly from the ſervice of vertue to ſerve the time, as if they repented their goodneſs, or meant not to make a ſecond hazard in Gods Houſe; but rather let this croſs make you zealous in Gods cauſe, ſenſible in ours, and more ſenſible in all, which expreſs thus. You have been a great enemy to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, if you love God, be ſo ſtill, but more indeed then heretofore: for much of your zeal was heretofore waſted in words: call to remembrance that they were the perſons that propheſied of that croſs of yours long before it hapned, they ſaw the ſtorm coming, being the principall contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and furtherers of the plot, the men that blew the coals, heat the Iron, and made all things ready, they owe you a good turn, and will, if they can, pay it you, you ſee their hearts by their deeds, prove then your faith ſo too. The beſt good work you can do, is to do the beſt you can againſt them, that is, to ſee the Law ſeverely, juſtly, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently executed. And now we beſeech you, my Lord, be ſenſible both of the ſtroak, and hand that ſtriketh: learn of <hi>David</hi> to leave <hi>Shimei,</hi> and call upon God, he hath ſome great work to do, and he prepareth you for it, he would neither have you faint, nor yet bear this croſs with a Stoical reſolution. There is a Chriſtian mediocrity worthy of your greatneſs I muſt be plain, perhaps raſh. Had ſome notes which you have taken at Sermons, been written in your heart to practiſe, this work had been done long ago, without the envy of your enemies: But when we will not mind our ſelves, God (if we belong to him) takes us in hand; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſeeth that we have unbridled ſtomacks, therefore he ſends out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward croſſes, which while they cauſe us to mourn, do comfort us, being aſſured teſtimonies of his love that ſends them: to humble our ſelves therefore before God, is the part of a Chriſtian; but for the world, and our enemies, the counſell of the Poet is apt, <hi>Tune cede malis, ſed contra andentior ito.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt part of this counſell you forget, yet none need be aſham'd to make uſe of it, that ſo being armed againſt caſualties, you may ſtand firm againſt the aſſaults on the right hand and on the left. For this is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:125863:41"/>certain, the mind that is moſt prone to be puft up with proſperity, is moſt weak and apt to be dejected with the leaſt puff of adverſity. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſhe is ſtrong enough to make an able man ſtagger, ſtriking terrible blows; but true Chriſtian wiſdom gives us armour of proof againſt all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, and teacheth us in all eſtates to be content: for though ſhe cauſe our trueſt friends to declare themſelves our enemies, though ſhe give heart then to the moſt cowardly to ſtrike us, though an hours continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance countervail an age of proſperity, though ſhe caſt in our diſh all that ever we have done, yet hath ſhe no power to hurt the humble and wiſe, but onely to break ſuch as too much proſperity hath made ſtiff in their own thoughts, but weak indeed and fitted for renewing, when the wiſe rather gather from thence profit and wiſdom by the example of <hi>David,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Before I was chaſtiſed, I went wrong.</hi> Now then, he that knoweth the right way, will look better to his footing. <hi>Gardan</hi> ſaith, That weeping, faſting, and ſighing, are the chief purgers of griefes: Indeed naturally they help to aſſwage ſorrow; but God in this caſe is the onely and beſt Phyſician: the means he hath ordained are the advice of friends, the amendment of our ſelves: for amendment is both Phyſitian and Cure. For friends, although your Lordſhip be ſcant, yet I hope you are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deſtitute; if you be, do but look on good books, they at true friends, that will neither flatter nor diſſemble; be you but true to your ſelf, applying what they teach unto the party grieved, and you ſhall need no other comfort nor counſell. To them, and to Gods holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit directing you in the reading of them, I commend your Lordſhip, beſeeching him to ſend you a good iſſue out of theſe troubles, and from henceforth to work a reformation in all that is amiſs, and a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute perſeverance, proceeding, and growth in all that is good, and that for his glory, the bettering of your ſelf, this Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, whoſe faithfull ſervant whilſt you remain, I remain a faithfull ſervant to you.</p>

            <head>To the Lord Treaſurer, concerning the Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citors place.</head>
            <p>AFter the remembrance of my humble duty, though I know by late experience how mindfull your Lordſhip vouchſafeth to be of me and my poor fortune; and ſince it pleaſed your Lordſhip during your indiſpoſition, when her Majeſty came to viſit your Lordſhip, to make mention of me for my imployment and preferment: yet being now in the Country, I do preſume that your Lordſhip, who of your ſelf had an honorable care of the matter, will not think it a trouble to be ſollicited therein. My hope is this, that whereas your Lordſhip told me her Majeſty was ſomwhat gravelled upon the offence ſhe took at my Speech in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, your Lordſhips favourable endeavour, who hath aſſured me that for your own part you conſtrue that I ſpake to the beſt, will be as a good tide to remove her from that ſhelf: And it is not unknown un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your good Lordſhip, that I was the firſt of the ordinary ſort of the lower Houſe that ſpake for the Subſidie; and that which I after ſpake in difference, was but in circumſtance of time, which methinks was no great matter, ſince there is variety allowed in Councel as a Diſcord in Muſick to make it more perfect.</p>
            <p>But I may juſtly doubt her Majeſties impreſſion upon this particular, as her conceipt otherwiſe of my inſufficiencie and unworthineſs: which though I acknowledge to be great, yet it will be the leſs, becauſe I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not to divide my ſelf between her Majeſty and the cauſes of other men, as others have done, but to attend her buſineſs only; hoping that a whole man meanly able, may do as well as half a man better able: And if her Majeſty thinketh that ſhe ſhall make an adveuture in uſing
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:125863:42"/>one that is rather a man of ſtudy then of practice and experience, ſurely I may remember to have heard that my Father (an example I confeſs rather ready then like) was made Sollicitor of the Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation (a Court of much buſineſs) when he had never practiſed, and was but 27 years old: And Mr. <hi>Brograve</hi> was now in my time called Attorney of the Dutchy, when he had practiſed little or nothing, and yet hath diſcharged his place with great ſufficiencie. But thoſe and the like things are as her Majeſty ſhall be made capable of them: wherein knowing what authority your Lordſhips commendations hath with her Majeſty, I conclude with my ſelf that the ſubſtance of ſtrength which I may receive will be from your Lordſhip. It is true, my life hath been ſo private, as I have had no means to do your Lordſhip ſervice: but yet, as your Lordſhip knoweth, I have made offer of ſuch as I could yield. For as God hath given me a mind to love the publique, ſo inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently I have ever had your Lordſhip in ſingular admiration, whoſe happy ability her Majeſty hath ſo long uſed to her great honour and yours. Beſides, that amendment of ſtate or countenance which I have received hath been from your Lordſhip: And therefore if your Lordſhip ſhall ſtand a good friend to your poor Ally, you ſhall but <hi>tueri opus</hi> which you have begun; and your Lordſhip ſhall bellow your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit upon one that hath more ſenſe of obligation, then of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love.</p>

Yet becauſe I think it will increaſe my practice, and that it may ſatisfie my friends, and becauſe I have been voiced to it, I would be glad it were done.

For ſurely were it not that I think my ſelf born for to do my Soveraign fervice, and therefore in that ſtation will I live and die; otherwiſe for mine own private comfort, it were better for me that the King ſhould blot me out of his book, or that I ſhould turn my courſe to endeavour to ſerve him in ſome other kind, then for me to ſtand thus at a ſtop, and to have that little reputation which by my induſtry I gather, to be ſcattered and taken away by continual diſgraces, every new man coming in before me; and ſure I am I ſhall never have fairer promiſes and hope

            <p> HOw honeſtly ready I have been, moſt gracious Soveraign, to do your Majeſty humble ſervice to the beſt of my power, and in a manner beyond my power as I now ſtand, I am not ſo unfortunate but your Majeſty knows; both in the Commiſſion of Union<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the labour wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of for men of my profeſſion, reſted moſt upon my hands; and this laſt Parliament for the Bill of Subſidy, both body and preamble. In the Bill of Attainders; of <hi>Treſham,</hi> and the reſt; in the matter of Purvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in the Eccleſiaſticall Petitions, in the grievances, and the like, as I was ever carefull not without good ſucceſs, ſometime to put forward that which was good, ſometime to keep back that which was worſe: ſo your Majeſty was ple ſed kindly to accept of my ſervices, and to ſay to me, ſuch conflicts were the warres of peace, and ſuch victories the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories of peace; and therefore ſuch ſervants as obtained them, were by Kings that reign in peace, no leſs to be eſteemed then Conquerors in the warres. In all which nevertheleſs I can challenge to my ſelf no ſufficiencie, that I was diligent and reaſonably happy to execute thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections which I received either immediatly from your Royall mouth, or from my Lord of <hi>Salisbury.</hi> At that time it pleaſed your Majeſty alſo to aſſure me that upon the remove of the then Attorney, I ſhould not be forgotten, but be brought into ordinary place: and this was after
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:125863:44"/>confirmed unto me by many of my Lords. And towards the end of the laſt Term, the manner alſo in particular ſpoken of, that is, that Mr. Sollicitor ſhould be made your Majeſties Serjeant, and I Sollicitor, for ſo it was thought beſt to ſort with both our gifts and faculties for the good of our ſervice. And of this reſolution both Court and Country took notice. Neither was this any invention or project of mine own, but moved from my Lords, I think firſt from my Lord Chancellor: whereupon reſting, your Majeſty well knoweth I never opened my mouth for the greater place, although I am ſure I had two circumſtances that Mr. Attorney that now is could not alleadge: the one, nine years ſervice of the Crown; the other, the being Couſin-german to my Lord of <hi>Salisbury;</hi> for of my Fathers ſervice I will not ſpeak. But for the leſs place, I conceive it was never meant me: but after that Mr. Attorny <hi>Hubbard</hi> was placed, I heard no more of any preferment, but it ſeemed to be at a ſtop, to my great diſgrace and diſcontentment. For, gracious Soveraign, if ſtill when the waters be ſtirred, another ſhall be put in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, your Majeſty had need work a miracle, or elſe I ſhall be a lame man to do your ſervices. And therefore my moſt humble ſuit unto your Majeſty is, That this which ſeemed to me intended, may ſpeedily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and I hope my former ſervice ſhall be but as beginnings to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when I am better ſtrengthened. For ſure I am, no mans heart is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, I ſay not but many may have greater hearts, but I ſay, not fuller of love and duty towards your Majeſty and your children, as I hope time wil manifeſt againſt envy and detraction, if any be.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I have done with great deſire, reputing it a token of your ſingular love, that you joyned me with thoſe your friends, to whom you would commend your firſt peruſall of your draught: for which I pray you give me leave to ſay but this unto you, Firſt, that if the depth of my affection to your perſon and ſpirit, to your works and your words, and to all your ability, were as highly to be valued as your affection is to me, it might walk with yours arm in arm, and claim your love by juſt deſert; but there can be no compariſon where our ſtates are ſo uneven, and our means to demonſtrate our affections ſo different, inſomuch as for mine own I muſt leave it to be prized in the nature that it is, and you ſhall evermore find it moſt addicted to your worth. As touching the ſubject of your Book, you have ſet afoot ſo many noble ſpeculations, as I cannot chuſe but wonder, and I ſhall wonder at it ever, that your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of time conſidered in your publique profeſſion, which hath in a manner no acquaintance with Scholarſhip or Learning, you ſhould have culled forth the quinteſſence, and ſucked up the ſap of the chiefeſt kind of Learning. For howſoever in ſome points you do vary altogether from that which is and hath been ever the received doctrine of our Schools
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:125863:45"/>and was always by the wiſeſt (as ſtill they have been deemed) of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; Ages adjudged the trueſt, and yet it is apparent that in thoſe very points, in all your propoſals and plots in that book, you ſhew your ſelf a Maſter workman. For my ſelf, I muſt confeſs, and I ſpeak it <hi>Ingenuè</hi> that for the matter of learning I am not worthy to be reckoned in the number of ſmatterers; and yet becauſe it may ſeem that being willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate your Treatiſe with your friends, you are likewiſe willing to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to whatſoever I or others can except againſt it: I muſt deliver unto you for my private opinion, that I am one of the crew that ſay there is, and we profeſs a greater holdfaſt of certainty in your Sciences, then you by your diſcourſe will ſeem to acknowledge: For where at firſt you do object the ill ſucceſs and errors of practitioners of Phyſick, you know as well they do proceed of the Patients unrulineſs: for not one of an hundred doth obey his Phyſitian in their own indiſpoſition, for few are able in that kind to explicate themſelves, or by reaſon their diſeaſes are by nature incurable, which is incident, you know, to many ſorts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies, or for ſome other hidden cauſe which cannot be diſcovered by courſe of conjecture; Howbeit I am full of this belief, that as Phyſick is miniſtred now-a-days by Phyſicians, it is much to be aſcribed to their negligence or ignorance, or other touch of imperfection that they ſpeed no better in their practiſe: for few are found of that profeſſion ſo well inſtructed in their Art, as they might by the precepts which their Art doth afford, which though it be defective in regard of ſuch perfection, yet for certain it doth flouriſh with admirable remedies, ſuch as tract of time hath taught by experimentall effects, and are the open high-way to that knowledge that you recommend. As for Alchimie and Magick, ſome concluſions they have that are worthy the preſerving: but all their skill is ſo accompanied with ſubtilties and guiles, as both the Crafts and the Crafts-maſters are not onely deſpiſed, but named with deriſion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to make good your principall aſſertion, methinks you ſhould have drawn the moſt of your examples from that which is taught in the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Sciences, not by picking out caſes that happen very ſeldom, and may by all confeſſion be ſubject to reproof, but by controlling the generals, and grounds, and eminent Poſitions and Aphoriſms which the greateſt Artiſts and Philoſophers have from time to time defended: for it goeth for currant among all men of learning, that thoſe kind of Arts which Clerks in times paſt did term <hi>Quadruials,</hi> confirm their propoſitions by infallible demonſtrations. And likewiſe in <hi>Trivials,</hi> ſuch leſſons and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections are delivered unto us, as will effect very neer, or as much alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as every faculty doth promiſe. Now in caſe we ſhould concur to do as you adviſe, which is to renounce our common notions, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:125863:46"/>all our Theorems, Axioms, Rules and Tenents, and ſo to come babes <hi>ad regnum naturae,</hi> we are willed by Scriptures to come <hi>ad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnum coelorum.</hi> There is nothing more certain in my underſtanding, then that it would inſtantly bring us to Barbariſm, and after many thouſand years leave us more unprovided of Theoricall furniture then we are at this preſent: For that were indeed to become <hi>Tabula raſa,</hi> when we ſhall leave no impreſſion of any former principle, but be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to begin the world again, to travell by trials of actions and ſenſe; (which are your proofs by particulars) what to place in <hi>intellectu</hi> for our generall conceptions, it being a Maxim of all mens approving, <hi>In in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectu nihil eſſe quod non prius fuit in ſenſu.</hi> And ſo in appearance it would befall us, that till <hi>Plato's</hi> year be come about, our inſight in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning would be of leſs reckoning then now it is accounted: As for that which you inculcate of a knowledge more excellent then now is among us, which experience might produce if we would but eſſay to extract it out of Nature by particular probations, it is no more upon the matter, but to incite us unto that which without inſtigation by a naturall inſtinct men will practice of themſelves: for it cannot in reaſon be otherwiſe thought, but that there are infinite in all parts of the world, (for we may not in this caſe confine our cogitations within the bounds of <hi>Europe</hi>) which embrace the courſe which you propoſe, with all diligence and care, that any ability can perform. For every man is born with an appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of knowledge, wherewith he cannot be glutted, but ſtill as in a drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie thirſt after more. But yet why men ſhould hearken to any ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, as wholly to aboliſh thoſe ſetled opinions, and generall Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to which they have attained by their own and their Anceſtors for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer experience, I ſee nothing yet alledged to induce me think it. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, I may ſpeake as I ſuppoſe with good probability, that if we ſhould make a mentall ſurvey what is like to be effected all the world over, thoſe five or ſix inventions which you have ſelected, and imagined to be but of modern ſtanding, would make but a ſlender ſhew among ſo many hundreds of all kinds of natures which are daily brought to light by the enforcement of wit or caſuall events, and maybe compared or partly preferred above thoſe that you have named. But were it ſo here, that all were admitted that you can require for the augmentation of our knowledge, and that all our Theorems and generall Poſitions were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly extinguiſhed with a new ſubſtitution of others in their places, what hope may we have of any benefit of learning by this alteration?

I remember here a note which <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terculus</hi> made of the incomparable wits of the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> in their flouriſhing ſtate, that there might be this reaſon of their notable downfall in their iſſue that came after, becauſe by nature, <hi>Quod ſummo ſtudio petitum eſt aſcendit in ſummum, difficiliſque imperfecto mora eſt:</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that men perceiving that they could not go further, being come to the ſtop, they turned back again of their own accord, forſaking thoſe ſtudies that are moſt in requeſt, &amp; betaking themſelves to new endevours, as if the thing they ſought had been by prevention fore-prized by others. So it fared in particular with the eloquence of that age, that when their ſucceſſors found that hardly they could equall, by no means excell their predeceſſors, they began to neglect the ſtudy thereof, and ſpeak for many hundred years in a ruſticall manner, till this later revolution brought the wheel about again by inflaming gallant ſpirits to give the onſet a-freſh, with ſtraining and ſtriving to climb unto the top and height of perfection, not in that gift alone, but in every other skill in any part of learning. For I do not hold it any erroneous conceit to think of every ſcience, that as now they they are profeſſed, ſo they have been before in all precedent ages, though not alike in all places, nor at all times alike in one and the ſame; but according to the changes and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of times with a more exact and plain, or with a more rude and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure kind of teaching.</p>
            <p>And if the queſtion ſhould be asked what proof I have of it, I have the doctrine of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and of the deepeſt learned Clerks of whom we have any means to take any notice, That as there is of other things, ſo there is of Sciences <hi>ortus &amp; interitus:</hi> which is alſo the meaning (if I ſhould expound it) of <hi>nihil novum ſub ſole,</hi> and is as well to be applied <hi>ad facta</hi> as <hi>ad dicta; ut nihil neque dictum neque factum, quod non eſt dictum aut factum prius.</hi> I have further for my warrant that famous complaint of <hi>Solomon</hi> to his ſon againſt the infinite making of books in his time, of which in all congruity great part were of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and inſtructions in all kind of literature, and of thoſe there is not now ſo much as one Pamphlet (only ſome parcels of the Bible excepted) remaining to poſterity. As then there was not in like manner to be found any footing of millions of Authors that were long before <hi>Solomon,</hi> and yet we muſt give credit to that which he affirmed; that whatſoever
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:125863:47"/>was then or before, it could never be truly pronounced of it, Behold this is new. Whereupon I muſt for my final concluſion infer, Seeing all the endeavours, ſtudy and knowledge of mankind in whatſoever art or ſcience have ever been the ſame as they are at this preſent, though full of mutabilities according to the changes and accidental occaſions of ages, and Countries and Clerks diſpoſitions, which can never but be ſubject to intention and remiſſion both in their devices and in their practiſes of their knowledge. If now we ſhould accord in opinion with you, Firſt to condemn our preſent knowledge of doubt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certitude (which you confer but by averment) without other force of argument, and then to diſclaim all our Axioms and Maxims, and general aſſertions that are left by tradition from our Elders to us, which (for ſo it is to be pretended) have paſſed all probations of the ſharpeſt wits that ever were <hi>Abecedarii,</hi> by the frequent ſpelling of particulars to come to the notice of new generals, and ſo afreſh to create new principles of Sciences, the end of all would be, that when we ſhould be diſpoſſeſſed of the learning which we have, all our conſequent travel will but help us in a circle to conduct us to the place from whence we ſet forwards, and bring us to the happineſs to be reſtored <hi>in integrum,</hi> which will require as many ages as have marched before us to be perfectly atchieved. And this I write with no diſlike of increaſing our knowledge with new-found devices (which is undoubtedly a practice of high commendation) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the benefit they will yield for the preſent, that the world hath ever been, and will aſſuredly continue very full of ſuch Deviſers, whoſe induſtry that way hath been very obſtinate and eminent, and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſtrange effects above the reach and the hope of mens common capacities; and yet our Notions and Theorems have always kept in grace both with them and with the rareſt that ever were named among the learned.</p>
            <p>By this you ſee to what boldneſs I am brought by your kindneſs, That (if I ſeem to be too ſawcy in this contradiction) it is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that I hold of your noble diſpoſition, and of the freedom in theſe caſes that you will afford your ſpecial friend, that hath induced me to do it. And although I my ſelf, like a Carriers horſe, cannot bawk the beaten way in which I have been trained; yet ſince it is my cenſure of your <hi>Cogitata</hi> that I muſt tell you, to be plain, you have very much wronged your ſelf and the world, to ſmother ſuch a treaſure ſo long in your coffer: For though I ſtand well aſſured (for the tenor and ſubject of your main diſcourſe) you are not able to impanel a Jury in any Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity that will give up a verdict to acquit you of error, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be gainſaid that all your Treatiſe over doth abound with choice
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:125863:47"/>conceipt of the preſent ſtate of learning, and with ſo worthy contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations of the means to procure it, as may perſwade with any Student to look more narrowly to his buſineſs, not only by aſpiring to the greateſt perfection of that which is now adayes divulged in the Sciences, but by diving yet deeper as it were into the bowels and ſecrets of nature, and by inforcing of the powers of his judgment and wit to learn of St. Paul, <hi>Conſectari meliora dona:</hi> which courſe would to God (to whiſper ſo much into your ear) you had followed at the firſt when you fell to the ſtudy of ſuch a ſtudy as was not worthy ſuch a Student. Nevertheleſs being ſo as it is, that you are therein ſetled, and your Country ſoundly ſerved, I cannot but wiſh with all my heart, as I do very often, that you may gain a fit reward to the full of your deſerts. Which I hope will come with heaps of happineſs and honour.</p>

            <p> THe meſſage which you ſent me of her Majeſties gracious purpoſe altered towards me, hath put me into that extaſie, that I know not whereupon to reſt my ſelf, not having power to believe that which I am bound to know. Is it poſſible that you ſhould be ſo weak in grace with her Majeſty, as not to prevail in ſo ſmall a matter for any man but of an intire reputation? or ſhall I believe that her Majeſty, who ſuffers not the merit of her ſervants to be buried with them, ſhould not hold
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:125863:48"/>me equivalent with any new <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> without father or mother. I proteſt (Madam) I could not preſage any ill ſucceſs to my ſelf, but onely out of the means of my ambition, and have held it therefore ſuperfluous to claim any favour in vertue of ſupererogation, eſteeming it too great a derogation from my ſelf for ſo poor a thing as a Spittle-houſe to raiſe the dead to ſpeak for me, or challenge any thing more then my own. But it is neither the ſtrangeneſs of the matter, nor the hardneſs of my belief that can alter the decree of a Prince. But I muſt take it in good payment, that is no leſs then for as great a diſgrace as can outwardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall me; yet muſt I ever hold my ſelf beholding to this ſuit: for though I loſe the Hoſpital, yet have I loſt many errors; withall I have weighed my friends in a balance, and taken a juſt meaſure of my fortune. I muſt not deſpair, it is not impoſſible for a man well taught to make a retreat into himſelf, neither will I yet deſpair of my ſuit, onely for this reaſon, that this change cannot proceed of her Majeſties proper motion, but muſt be procured by ſome blind practiſe that dares not ſee the light, though it may be my fortune to bring it forth bluſhing; howſoever it be, it ſhall never diſtemper my dutifull affection towards her Majeſty, though that be for ever barred from her knowledge: for they who are able to prevent her goodneſs, will be ever likely to prevent my ſervice. That the place is already meant to a Divine, cannot be true, nor my impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For there is no kind of her Majeſties ſervants and ſubjects ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, there being ſuch ſtore of places that fall daily both better then this in value, and more proper for their function. Your Ladiſhip hath been hitherto an honorable and faithfull interceſſor for me; Good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, be not weary to continue ſo ſtill, as I ſhall do ever to acknowledge it, and if I be able, in part to deſerve it.</p>

            <head>The Roman Catholiques Petition to King <hi>James</hi> for Toleration.</head>
            <p>MOſt puiſſant Prince, and orient Monarch! Such are the rare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and admirable gifts of wiſdom, prudence, valour, and juſtice, wherewith the bountifull hand of Gods divine Majeſty hath endued your Majeſty, as in the depth of your provident judgment we doubt not but you foreſee what concerneth both the ſpiritual and temporal Government of all your Kingdoms and Dominions. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding your Graces moſt afflicted Subjects and devoted Servants the Catholiques of <hi>England,</hi> partly to prevent, ſiniſter informations which haply may poſſeſs your ſacred ears before our anſwer be heard, partly as men almoſt overwhelmed with perſections for our conſidences, we are inforced to have ſpeedy recourſe in hope of preſent redreſs from your Highneſs, and to preſent theſe humble lines unto your Royal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to plead for us ſome commiſeration and favour. Alas, what allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or duty can any Temporal Prince deſire or expect at his Vaſſals hands, which we are not addreſſed to perform? How many Noblemen and worthy Gentlemen, moſt zealous in the Catholique Religion, have endured, ſome loſs of lands and livings, ſome exile, others impriſonment, ſome the effuſion of blood and life, for the advancement of your bleſſed Mothers right unto the Scepter of <hi>Albion?</hi> Nay, whoſe finger did ever ake but Catholiques, for your Majeſties preſent title and dominions? How many fled to your Court, offering themſelves as hoſtages for their friends to live arid die in your gracious quarrel, if ever adverſary had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelf againſt the equity of your cauſe? If this they attempted with their Princes diſgrace to obtain your Majeſties grace, what will they do, nay what will they not do to live without diſgrace in your Graces fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor? The main of this Realm, if we reſpect Religion, ſetting petty Sects aſide, conſiſts of four parts: Proteſtants, who have domineered all the Queens dayes; Puritans, who have crept up apace amongſt them; Atheiſts or Polititians, who were bred upon their brawls and contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in matters of faith; and Catholiques, who as they are oppoſite to all, ſo are they deteſted of all, becauſe error was ever an enemy to truth. Hardly all, or any two of the firſt three can be ſuppreſſed: Therefore we beſeech your Majeſty to yield us as much ſavour, as others of contrary Religion to that which ſhall be publiquely profeſſed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſhall obtain at your hands; For if our fault be like leſs, or none at
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:125863:49"/>all, in equity our puniſhment ought to be like leſs, or none at all. The Gates, Arches, and Pyramids of <hi>France</hi> proclaimed the preſent King <hi>Pater patria &amp; Pacis reſtitutor,</hi> that is, the Father of his Country, and Reſtorer of their peace; becauſe that Kingdom being well neer torn in peeces with Civil wars, and made a prey to foraign foes, was by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, wiſdom and valour acquitted in it ſelf, and hoſtile ſtrangers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled; the which he principally effected by condeſcending to tolerate them of an adverſe Religion to that which was openly profeſſed. Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſsm Dread Soveraign, the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> through the cruel perſecution of Catholiques, hath been almoſt odious to all Chriſtian Nations: Trade and traffique is exceedingly decayed, Wars and blood hath ſeldom ceaſed, Subſidies and Taxes never ſo many, diſcontented minds innumerable. All which your Princely Majeſties connivance to your humble ſuppliants the afflicted Catholiques, will eaſily eaſily redreſs, eſpecially at this your Highneſs fiſft ingreſs. <hi>Si loquaris ad nos verba levia, erunt tibi ſervi cunctis diebus.</hi> (1 <hi>King</hi> 7.7.) that is, if you ſpeak comfortable things unto them, or if you hearken unto them in this thing, they will be ſervants unto you, or they will ſerve all their days,] ſay the ſage Councellors of <hi>Solomon</hi> to <hi>Roboam.</hi> For, enlargement after affliction reſembleth a pleaſant gale after a vehement tempeſt; and a benefit in diſtreſs, doubleth the value thereof How gratefull will it be to all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Princes abroad, and honorable to your Majeſty, to underſtand how Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> ſeverity is changed into your Royal clemencie; and that the lenity of a man reedified what the miſinformed anger of, a woman deſtroyed; that the Lyon rampant is paſſant, whereas the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant had been rampant. How acceptable ſhall your Subjects be to all Catholique Countries, who are now almoſt abhorred of all, when they ſhall perceive your Highneſs prepareth not pikes or priſons for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of their Faith, but permitteth them Temples and Altars for the uſe of their Religion. Then we ſhall ſee with our eyes, and touch with our fingers that happy benediction of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.7. in this Land, that ſwords are turned into mattocks or ploughs, and lances into ſithes; and all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions admiring us will ſay, <hi>Hi ſunt ſemen cui benedixit Dominus,</hi> that is, theſe are the ſeed which the Lord hath bleſſed.</p>
            <p>We requeſt no more favour at your Graces hands, then that we may ſecurely believe and profeſs that Catholique Religion which all your happy Predeceſſors profeſſed, from <hi>Donaldus</hi> the firſt converted, unto your late bleſſed Mother martyred; a Religion venerable for anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, majeſtical for amplitude, conſtant for continuance, irrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible for doctrine, inducing to all kind of vertue and piety, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading from all ſin and wickedneſs; a religion beloved by all primitive
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:125863:50"/>Paſtors, eſtabliſhed by all Occumenicall Councels, upholden by ancient Doctors, maintained by the firſt and beſt Chriſtian Emperours, recorded almoſt alone in all Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories, ſealed with the blood of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Martyrs, adorned with the vertues of ſo many Confeſſors, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with the purity of thouſands of virgins, ſo conformable unto natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſenſe and reaſon; and finally, ſo agreeable with the ſacred Texts of Gods Word and Goſpell: The free uſe of this Religion we requeſt, if not in publick Churches, at the leaſt in private houſes; if not with appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, yet with toleration without moleſtation. Aſſuring your Grace, that howſoever ſome Proteſtants or Puritans incited by morall honeſty of life, or innated inſtinct of nature, or for fear of ſome temporall puniſhment, pretend obedience unto your Highneſs Laws; yet certainly the onely Catholiques for conſcience ſake obſerve them: For they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending that Princes Precepts and Statutes oblige no ſubject under the penalty of ſin, will have little care in conſcience to tranſgreſs them, which principally are tormented with the guilt of fin. But Catholiques profeſſing merit in obeying, and immerit in tranſgreſſing, cannot but in Soul be grievouſly tortured for the leaſt prevarication thereof: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, moſt mercifull Soveraign, we your loving afflicted ſubjects, in all dutifull ſubjection, proteſt before the Majeſty of God, and all his holy Angels, as loyal obedience, and immaculate allegiance unto your Grace, as ever did faithfull ſubjects in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland</hi> unto your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Progenitors, and intend as ſincerely with our goods and lives to ſerve you, as ever did the loyalleſt Iſraelites King <hi>David,</hi> or the truſtieſt Legions the Roman Emperours. And thus expecting your Majeſties cuſtomary favour and gracious bounty, we reſt your devoted ſuppliants to him whoſe hands do manage the hearts of Kings, and with recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate mercy will requite the mercifull.</p>

            <p> I Am very ſorry this occaſion ſhould have been offered me by the King your Maſter, which makes me troubleſom to you for the preſent. It is reported to me by men of honour, the great wrong the King of the <hi>Danes</hi> hath done me, when I was not by to anſwer for my ſelf: For if I had been preſent, I would have letten him know how much I ſcorn to receive that wrong at his hands. I need not to urge the particular of it, for the King himſelf knows it beſt. I proteſt to you Sir, I did think as honorably of the King your Maſter, as I did of my own Prince; but now I perſwade my ſelf there is as much baſeneſs in him as can be in any man: For although he be a Prince by birth, it ſeems not to me that there harbours any Princely thought in his breaſt; for either in Prince or Subject, it is the baſeſt that can be to wrong any woman of honour: I deſerve as little that name he gave me, as either the mother of himſelf or of his children; and if ever I come to know what man hath informed your Maſter ſo wrongfully of me, I ſhould do my beſt for putting him from doing the like to any other: but if it hath come by the tongue of any woman, I dare ſay ſhe would be glad to have companions. So leaving to trouble you any further, I reſt, </p>

            <p>YOur Majeſty hath ſhewed the ſincerity of your Royal heart in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying remedy to many inconveniences and injuſtice offered by your Miniſters to the King my maſters ſubjects in their goods and bodies, and therein have performed not only what belongeth to your Kingly dignity, but alſo what might be expected from a Prince ſo zealous of juſtice and of ſo good intention. It reſteth that now I beſeech you to caſt your Royal eyes upon another extreme injuſtice offered not only to their bodies and goods, but to their very ſouls; who being by your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:125863:56"/>agreement confirmed with your oath to live within theſe your Kingdoms free from moleſtation for matter of opinion and conſcience, except in matters of ſcandal to others, are here laid hold on and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned by your Majeſties Officers of Inquiſition continually upon every light occaſion of private information of ſome particular perſons of their own Country, who being fugitives out of their own houſes, and having according to the nature of our people removed not only their bodies, but their hearts from the ſoil that bred them, and from their brethren that were nouriſhed with them, do here ſeek to grace themſelves by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing and teaching the obſervations of the Romiſh Church; and that not out of any zeal, but as plainly appeareth by many of their actions, out of malice and envy. By the Commiſſioners authorized by both your Majeſties for the agreeing of the Peace, it was clearly diſcerned, that if upon private or particular informations his Majeſties vaſſals here ſhould be queſtioned for matter of Religion, it was not poſſible that they ſhould exerciſe any commerce in theſe kingdoms, where they ſhould be no one moment aſſured either of their goods or liberties. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore provided that they ſhould in no ſort be impeached but in caſe of ſcandal; and that ſcandal, with your Majeſties favour, muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to grow out of ſome publike action, not out of private opinion or ſingle conſcience; for if otherwiſe, very vain and inutile had been that proviſion. How the word <hi>ſcandal</hi> is in the moſt uſual and common ſenſe to be underſtood, is in no books more evident then in the Divine Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures themſelves. Our Saviour, in regard of his publique teaching of the Goſpel, and the aboliſhing of the Law-Ceremonial, was ſaid to be to both houſes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> a ſtone of ſcandal. The ſin of <hi>David,</hi> if it had lain covered in his own heart, or been committed in private, ſhould not have been either publiſhed or puniſhed as a ſcandal to the enemies of God. St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf declareth, that his own eating of fleſh offered to Idols could not be an offence, but only his eating before others of weak conſcience whereby to give the ſcandal. Beſides, I humbly beſeech your Majeſty conſider how fitly that of the Apoſtle <hi>Quis es qui judicas ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enum ſervum,</hi> may be applied to thoſe Officers of the Inquiſition at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to lay hands on the ſubjects of another Prince your Majeſties confederate, offering none offence to the Laws, or publike prejudice to their profeſſion: yea, in divers parts of your Majeſties dominions the ſubjects of my Maſter have ſuffered this reſtraint. The Inquiſitor-Generall lately deceaſed, who in all his actions ſhewed himſelf a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate Miniſter, and carefull in regard of your Majeſties honour of the obſerving of what you have capitulated, upon my complaint never failed to give the remedy that in juſtice I required. He being now with God,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:125863:57"/>and one of my Soveraigns ſubjects having been long without cauſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Inquiſitors in <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and another of good account, a man moderate and temperate in all his actions, lately apprehended by that Office in <hi>Almonte,</hi> and reſtrained in their priſon at <hi>Sivil:</hi> I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded from his Majeſty, and importuned by my Country-men, who all with one voice complain and proteſt that they dare not longer continue their commerce without preſent order for remedy of ſo extream and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous an injuſtice, do beſeech your Majeſty that you will be pleaſed not only to give preſent order for the releaſe of thoſe that without ſcandal are known for the preſent in your priſons, but alſo that in time to come the true intention of that Article be obſerved, which is, That without known offence and ſcandal the King my Maſters ſubjects be not moleſted. The accompliſhment of this (conſidering how much it imports your Majeſty in honour, your Majeſty and the Archduke having in that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle in no other ſort then in all the reſt covenanted by eſpecial words, that your ſelves would provide that in no caſe but only in giving ſcandal to others, the ſubjects of my Soveraign ſhould be troubled for their conſciences) I cannot but expect from ſo juſt and ſincere a Prince: And therefore will not trouble your Majeſty with more words; but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering my ſelf in all things within my power to your Majeſties ſervice, I remain with a deſire to be reckoned in the number of your Majeſties humble and affectionate ſervants,</p>

            <p>WEll knoweth your Majeſty in your Royall wiſdom, how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Kings is the conſervation of authority and reſpect to their Kingly dignities; as alſo that the greateſt and moſt abſolute pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Juſtice, is to do to others what we would be done unto our ſelves: How religiouſly &amp; punctually the King my maſter hath obſerved theſe unto your Majeſty, hath appeared by many demonſtrations, and not the leaſt in the deniall he made to <hi>Antonio de Perez</hi> to abide in his Kingdom, or to have acceſſe to his perſon; onely out of a conceit he had, that he came with a mind determined to diſauthorize your Majeſty in his ſpeeches, or to make offer of ſome practiſe againſt your eſtates in his overtures. Your Majeſties own Royall and gratefull inclination I know to be ſuch, as you are not without deſire to pay my Soveraign with the like equivalent retribution: but with your Majeſties pardon and favour, duty inforceth me plainly to tell you, that the Miniſters of theſe your Kingdoms ſhew not the like affection; where not one, but many my of Soveraigns worſt affected ſubject are daily received, cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and honored with entertainments in your ſervice. Were that ſort of people contented onely to abuſe your Majeſties Kingly munificence and Chriſtian charity, and to deceive your Miniſters with their falſified ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies, and with putting the <hi>Don</hi> upon many whoſe fathers and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors were ſo baſe and beggerly, as they never arrived to be owners of ſo much as convenient apparell to cover their nakedneſs, it were much more tolerable: but when having here taſted the warmth of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties liberall and pious hand, they become furniſhed in ſuch ample and abundant manner, as their poor and miſerable anceſtors durſt never ſo much as dream of, like <hi>Aeſops</hi> ſerpent they turn their venemous ſtings towards the boſoms that gave them heat and life, and endeavour with all the force and Art they have, to give cauſe of diſtaſte, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of diviſion between your Majeſty and your faithfulleſt and moſt powerful Confederate, in uneven paiment for your Majeſties ſo great and gracious favour.

The other deſcended rather of

            <p>YOur Majeſty to whom <hi>God</hi> hath given ſo large an Empire, &amp; ſo much exceeding that of other Princes, and whom he hath bleſſed with ſo great an inclination to piety, clemency, and other vertues becoming your Royall dignity and Perſon, will I know hold it evil beſeemmg ſo rare a greatneſs, to come behind any King how pious &amp; vertuous ſoever, either in the obſervance of the laws of mutual charity and friendſhip, or in love or zeal to juſtice, which to all Kingdoms and Governments gives the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:125863:59"/>aſſuredſt foundation; and in defect whereof by the Spirit of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Kingdoms are ſaid to be tranſlated from one Nation to another. The firſt King that God gave unto his people, he elected of higher ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then the reſt by the ſhoulders upwards, ſignifying thereby how much Kings are to ſtrive to exceed and excell in the height and meaſure of vertue and juſtice; alſo how fit it is for them to over-look with their authorities and providences the higheſt head of their Miniſters, and to obſerve how they guide themſelves.</p>
            <p>By the contents of this paper incloſed, your Majeſty ſhall perceive the Chriſtian and Kingly care the King my Maſter hath had, not onely of the obſervances of the Articles of Peace ſince the ſame between your Majeſties were concluded; but of the punctuall accompliſhment of the true Laws of amity and friendſhip, which are more ſurely and expreſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imprinted in Royall and Noble hearts, then poſſibly they can be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or charactered by any pen in paper. In your Majeſties Kingdoms (pardon I humbly beſeech you if I ſpeak plainly) much contrary to that example, the King my Maſters ſubjects ſuffer all manner of ſpoils, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and miſeries, and are (as well I may term them) made a very prey to the hungry and greedy; your Viceroyes and others enter their ſhips under cover and colour of Peace and Juſtice, finding them rich, they lay crimes to their charge, whereof there appears neither proof nor probability; yet ſerve their pretences to poſſeſs them of their goods, &amp; to put the poor Merchants to a demand in Law: wherein were truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone the ballance they ſhould be weighed by, (though that form of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs were far ſhort of the immediate remedy provided by the King my Soveraign for your Majeſties ſubjects) yet were it much more allowable and to be endured; but having here complained two whole years with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any courſe at all taken for redreſs, as in the cauſe with the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> three intire years, as in that with the Viceroy of <hi>Sardinia</hi> one year and more, as in that of his Majeſties ſervant <hi>Adrian Thibaut,</hi> taken and ſpoiled by your Majeſties Generall <hi>Don Luis;</hi> as in that of <hi>Eſtry</hi> and <hi>Biſpich,</hi> impriſoned and bereaved of their goods by <hi>Iuan de Vendorza Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calde</hi> of <hi>Madrid,</hi> we are after ſo long a time ſpent in miſery and charge countervailing a great part of the value of the goods taken from us, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced ſtill to all punctualities and extremities of forms of law, and to abide the uttermoſt perill of all advantages that by the inventions, wits &amp; tongues of Lawyers can be deviſed, to obſcure and hide the light and right of truth. The falſe colour given by every of theſe, and the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous cruelty uſed to the parties, would require too long and tedious a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration. It ſatisfieth that none of their pretences are proved; nay, which is more they are ſo falſe and fabulous as to no indifferent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding they appear ſo much as probable.</p>
            <pb n="103" facs="tcp:125863:59"/>
            <p>My humble deſire is, your Majeſty would be pleaſed to paſs your own Royal eyes upon this paper; and therefore to affect all poſſible brevity, I will paſs unto your Majeſties other inferior miniſters of your Ports, of which few there are (thoſe in <hi>Biſcay,</hi> and ſome in <hi>Portugal</hi> only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) where we have not divers oppreſſions, impriſonments, and unjuſt imbargements, in <hi>Sivil</hi> eſpecially; whereof forty ſeveral ſuits, and as many falſe ſentences given, raiſed and purſued by a man now dead, and therefore in charity left unnamed. We have hitherto in your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Councel of war (where before thoſe noble Lords all paſſed by the equal line of Juſtice) not failed in my remembrance in the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing of any, ſave one miſtaken that paſſed in a wrong name, and another concerning merchandiſe that had their manufacture in <hi>Embden,</hi> (whereof I ſuppoſe thoſe Lords were not rightly informed) only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. In that Court I muſt acknowledge we have had redreſs, but yet with your Majeſties favour a miſerable one; our gain being whether we ſhall be owners of our own or not, our expences and charges certain, and the time without meaſure large, whereby many have been undone, ſome dead in priſon in <hi>England</hi> for want of what was unjuſtly detained from them here. Yet neither the falſe Judges in <hi>Sivil</hi> nor Promoters ever chaſtiſed, or for any thing that I yet have underſtood, ſo much as ever reprehended or found fault with.</p>
            <p>I haſte to a concluſion, fearing leſt I ſhould dwell too long in a matter ſo unſavoury and unpleaſing to your Majeſties pittifull ears and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian heart, ſo much of it ſelf diſpoſed to all clemency and piety. I will for the next reſort to the ſhips, cordage, corn, and other victuals and proviſions taken from the King my Soveraigns ſubjects for your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties own ſervices, and the relief of the extreme neceſſity in your Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and Garriſons of the Navy, of whom ſome have been enforced for want of payment of their monies to ſend their ſhips home unfreighted, a loſs extreme to poor Merchants that live by trade and time, to repair to this Court, and here remain ſome of them 14 moneths, and others two years and more, till their very charges had eaten out a great part of what was due unto them, and in the end recover only their own without any relief or recompence either for their expences, times loſt, or damages. I will only inſtance two, becauſe their cauſes are moſt ſtrange and pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and yet unſatisfied; the one named <hi>Thomas Harriſon,</hi> and the other <hi>Richard Morris:</hi> The firſt ſerved your Majeſty with his ſhip, till the ſame with one of his ſons and all of his men were ſwallowed with the ſeas, and hath been here more then four years ſuing for his recompence and ſalary, recommended by the King my Soveraign, by Letters from your Majeſties Ambaſſadors in <hi>England,</hi> and by my ſelf all that long
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:125863:60"/>time furthered with my earneſt ſollicitation; which hath begot infinite promiſes, but to this day no manner of payment or performance: The other, who ſometimes hath been a man of wealth and reputation, and falling into great poverty, ſerved your Majeſty with all that in the world he was worth, and all that in value above 6000 Ryals. I bluſh I proteſt to think of it, and my heart is grieved to mention it to ſo great a King, of whoſe liberality and magnificence the world taketh ſo much notice. His right and his neceſſity being well known unto your Officers, he hath been more then three years and a half fed with hopes, and put off with ſchedules and ſending from one Port to another for the receipt of his mony, till he hath indebted himſelf the moſt part of the ſum, and at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent wanteth wherewith both to feed and cover him. Now at laſt he is promiſed payment out here of your Royal cheſts, but after ſo many ceremonies and circumſtances to be performed with your Officers in other parts, as God knows hunger may end the poor man before they begin to ſatisfie him. By all this will plainly appear to your Majeſty, that your Majeſties ſubjects are by the favour and Chriſtian juſtice of the King my maſter entred into the new Teſtament and law of Grace, haying reſtitution and remedy without the delayes of ceremony and formality; and we ſtill remain under the old, and tyed in ail things to the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of the Law, to the burthenous circumſtances and intolerable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory formalities of proceeding in this your Kingdom, and what elſe your unpittifull Miniſters will out of uncharitable and unſenſible minds of other mens harms charge and impoſe upon us.</p>
            <p>Well doth your Majeſty conceive, that would the King my Maſter wink at the like courſes to be taken by his ſubjects and miniſters with ſuch of yours as they might meet upon the ſeas, the Engliſh are not of ſo little invention, but they could deviſe as good colours and pretences; nor their Lawyers of ſo ſmall skill and ſo much conſcience, but they could form and protract ſuits; nor the ſhips of <hi>England</hi> ſo weakened and leſſened, but they could equal and ſurmount their loſſes. I have out of mine own humble affection to your Majeſty, out of my generall and ever continuing deſire to hold firm the ancient amity ſo neceſſary for your own eſtates, and utile for the whole common-weal of Chriſtendom, out of the force of duty I owe to my King and Country, thus far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to unburthen my ſoul and thoughts, not doubting but your Majeſties magnanimous and Chriſtian heart will be moved as well in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to equal the pious and immutable example of the King my Maſter, as in a juſt compaſſion of a Nation now confederate with you, and that ſo gladly would entertain any cauſe to love and ſerve you, to give pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent remedy to thoſe wofull and intolerable oppreſſions; and that ſince
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:125863:60"/>you have firmed and conſented by your Articles of Peace of new orders (which being confirmed by your oath ſtand now in force of Laws) you would be pleaſed in like manner to give them a new form of indilatory execution, conformable to that of the King my Soveraign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p> IT may be interpreted diſcretion ſomtimes to wink at private wrongs, eſpecially for ſuch a one as my ſelf, that have a long time wraſtled with a hard Fortune, and whoſe actions, words and behaviour are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſubject to the cenſure of a whole State; yet not to be ſenſible of publique and Nationall diſgrace, were ſtupidity and baſeneſs of mind: For no place, nor time, nor State can excuſe a man from performing that duty and obligation wherein Nature hath tied him to his Countrey and to himſelf. This I ſpeak in regard of certain infamous verſes lately by your Lordſhips means diſperſed abroad to diſgrace my Countrey and my ſelf, and to wrong and ſtain by me the honor of a worthy and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Gentlewoman, whoſe unſpotted and immaculate vertue your ſelf is ſo much more bound to admire and uphold, in that having diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably aſſaulted it, you could not prevail. But belike, my Lord, you dare do any thing but that which is good and juſt. Think not to bear down theſe things either by greatneſs or denyall; for the circumſtances that prove them are ſo evident, and the veil wherewith you would ſhadow them, is too tranſparant. Neither would I have you flatter your ſelf, as though, like another <hi>Giges,</hi> you could paſſe in your courſes inviſible. If you owe a ſpight to any of my countrey-men, it is a poor revenge to rail upon me in verſe: or if the repulſe of your lewd deſire at the Gentlewomans hands, hath inflamed and exaſperated your choler againſt her, it was never known that to refuſe <hi>Northumberlands</hi> unlawfull luſt was a crime for a Gentlewoman deſerving to have her honour called in queſtion. For her part, I doubt not but her own unſpotted vertue will eaſily wipe out any blot which your malice would caſt upon it; and for me and my Countreymen (know my good Lord) that ſuch blowes as come in rime, are too weak to reach or harm us. I am aſham'd in your Lordſhips behalfe for theſe proceedings, and ſorry that the world muſt now ſee how long it hath been miſtaken in <hi>Northumberlands</hi> ſpirit: and yet who will not commend your wiſdom in chuſing ſuch a ſafe courſe to wrong a woman &amp; a priſoner; the one of which cannot, and the other by nature &amp; quality of the place, may not right his own wrongs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (ſetting aſide the moſt honorable order of the Garter, and poteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that whatſoever is here ſaid, is no way intended to the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>England</hi> in generall, which I doubt not but will condemn this

If theſe words ſound harſhly in your Lordſhips ear, blame your ſelf, ſince your ſelf forgetting your ſelf have taught others how to diſhonour you: And remember that though Nobility make a difference of perſons, yet Injury acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth none.</p>

               <salute>My Lords,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p> I Humbly beſeech you to think that I ſtand not here either to outface the Court, or to defend this cauſe otherwiſe then juſtly I may; only I deſire in mine own perſon to ſecond the ſubmiſſion which hath been opened by my Councel: for hitherunto hath nothing been opened unto you, but that which hath paſſed under the adviſed pen of others, and hitherto hath appeared from my ſelf neither open nor inward acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment.</p>
            <p>My Lords, it may ſeem ſtrange to the hearers, that againſt a Bill ſo ſharpned I ſhould abruptly fall upon a ſubmiſſion or confeſſion, whereby I may ſeem to bow down my neck to the ſtroke. But my Lords, in this I weighed not my ſelf, but I did it to amplifie the honour and mercy of his Majeſty, from whom I may ſay Clemencie ſprings as the blood that runs in his own veins. For, my Lords, when this Charter was ſometime que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, &amp; divers of my Lords here preſent had out of their great wiſdoms diſcovered that ſhame in it (which I muſt here confeſs I did not then ſee) &amp; had related the ſame to his Majeſty, it pleaſed his Maj. out of his great favour to me his unworthy ſervant to ſend me this meſſage by two great honorable perſons here preſent, and therefore under your Lordſhips fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour I think not fit to hide ſo great a favour of his Maj. from the eyes of the people, who offered to my choice either to ſubmit to himſelf in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, or defend here openly; and when I ſaw I fell into ſuch faithful hands, I remember my anſwer then was, that the offer was gracious, and the choice was eaſie, and his mercy free. After came this Information againſt
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:125863:62"/>me: I took it but as trial whether I would make his Majeſty King of my confidence, or not: And though there was offered unto me and my Councel ſuch a way of defence as I might have eſcaped, yet I proteſt I did reject it, becauſe I would not diſtruſt his Majeſties mercy to let go the anchor-hold I had thereof; and whatſoever becomes of me, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt I ſhall ſtill honour the King, though I go lame to my grave. I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly confeſs the manifold errors of this Charter to your Lordſhips, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have miſcarried; and I beſeech his Majeſty and your Lordſhips to think they are rather crept in unawares, then uſher'd in by conſent. The errors are of divers natures, ſome of negligence, ſome of ignorance, ſome of miſpriſion; I miſtook many things, I was improvident in ſome things, too credulous in all things. But I who was choſen, when I had ſo much provoked his Majeſty by mine unexperienced years, and having ſince found ſo many favours from his Majeſties hands, and this day having ſerved him full ſeven years, who this day hath tranſlated me from a low eſtate unto a place whereof I enjoy now only the name, and now ſince hath ſo much quickned and enlightned me by his gracious counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and aſſured me by his daily favours to make me to depend upon him; and that I ſhould deliberately and determinately take any flowers from his Crown to place them on the heads of others, or to betray his Majeſties intereſt into the hands of others, I hope his Majeſty will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe me ſo much favour not to value me at ſo low a rate, as to think theſe things came in <hi>de induſtria:</hi> For if I had felt any ſuch Eccho ariſe in my breaſt, I proteſt I would have laid hands on my ſelf, and judged my ſelf unworthy of any ſociety.</p>
            <p>My Lords, the corruption of my hands are far inferior to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the heart; and the hand that runs wilfully into error, works meerly from the corruption of the heart, and that makes it the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, as the bleeding of a wound inwardly ever becomes mortal; and were I conſcious to my ſelf, I would not have any color of excuſe. I thank his Majeſties Councel that howſoever theſe hands were at firſt miſtruſted, yet ſince they are not at all miſdoubted, nor the leaſt corruption laid to my charge. But this doth moſt grieve me, that my faithfulneſs to his Majeſty ſhould be ſuſpected: And I humbly deſire upon my knees, that his Clemencie in this caſe may ſtop the iſſue of his Juſtice; that though a long time his face hath been hid, yet now at length his mercy will break through the clouds to ſupport me that am now fallen. I lay my ſelf at his Majeſties feet to do with me as it pleaſeth him, and humbly deſire his Majeſty would take me to his own ſentence. I never thought of my ſelf otherwiſe then clay in his Majeſties hands, to mould me to honour or diſhonour. When I look and behold this ſolemnity and ſpectacle
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:125863:62"/>about me, I make no other account of it then <hi>Pompa mortis;</hi> and ſuch a Prince as he is, knows that Liſe and Reputation are equall, if the laſt be not the greateſt. I know your Lordſhips have ſuch power, and his Majeſty takes ſuch pleaſure in you, you are ſo dear in his eyes, that he can deny you nothing, and therefore I would deſire you that you would be ſuiters in my behalf, that his favour might once again ſhine upon me. I know his grace and clemency ſleepeth, if I be not unworthy to partake, and the rather becauſe the River that did run another way, is now turned into the Sea again, and the Charter given up, ſurrendred and cancelled. I know much life might be added to the ſinewes of my happineſſe by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips interceſſions for me; in vouchſafing, whereof I ſhall pledge a perpetuall aſſurance of better ſervice for the time to come, and ſhall be bound and engaged to every one of your Lordſhips: ſo that my deſire is, that his Majeſty might firſt be acquainted with this ſubmiſſion before you proceed into the merits of the cauſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſtill a priſoner to his Juſtice, knowing his Majeſty may if he pleaſe, turn me to vanity.</p>

            <p> WHat my mind and purpoſe is touching the tranſlating of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectorſhip to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> according to the promiſe I made him, and wherefore I think that buſineſs ſo neceſſary and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, as for <hi>Germany</hi> in generall, ſo particularly for ſecuring our Houſe from all attempts of Heretiques, as his Holineſs exhorts me not to be further delayed: You ſhall underſtand as well by conference with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jacinthus,</hi> whom his Holineſs hath for that purpoſe addreſſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, his Majeſty of <hi>Spain</hi> my Nephew, and other Catholiqne Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> as by theſe enſuing reaſons, whereof the principall are, That when I repeat from the beginning the whole courſe of my Reign, and the difficulties through which I have attained my Kingdoms and Provinces, I behold with reverence the admirable providence of God over me, which makes me the more bound to repoſe my truſt in him, and not to omit any occaſion which may tend to the advancement of his glory, and the honor of ſo admirable tried providence: and therfore that I ſhould uſe that moſt notable victory to the honor of God, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of all ſeditions factions, which are nouriſhed chiefly among the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and that I ſhould withdraw my ſelf from that judgement that the Prophet threatens to the King of <hi>Iſrael, Becauſe thou haſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed a man worthy of death, thy Son ſhall be for his ſoule.</hi> The Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine keeps now in <hi>Holland,</hi> exiled not onely from the Kingdom which he raſhly attempted, but deſpoiled almoſt of all his own Territories, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting as it were the laſt caſt of Fortune; whom, if by an impious kind of commiſeration and ſubtile Petitions, I be perſwaded to reſtore to his Electorall dignity, and nouriſh in my boſome as a troden half living ſnake, what can I expect leſs then a deadly ſtinging? For it is in vain for me to think that he ſhould be able to diſcern the greatneſs of ſuch a benefit: For the Polititians ſaying is true, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltionem quaeſivi, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam oneri habere,</hi> eſpecially ſince the injuries he did me are ſo heynous,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:125863:63"/>his projects ſo ſubtile, that although I ſhould overcome him with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian charity, yet I ſhould never be able to take him from the guilt of his offences, and make him ſoundly faithfull unto me; but he will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways gape at all occaſions whereby he may free himſelf from fear of his ill deſervings, and cover his own proſtituted honor with new attempts. Add hereunto the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> inſtitution, of whoſe Sect the proper genius is to hold nothing either fraud or wickedneſs, which is undertaken for the Religion; no ſanctity of oath, nor fear of diſhonour hinders them. From ſuch an one, what caution can either the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> or other Catholique Princes with whom he is no leſs in enmity, becauſe for Religion, as becauſe they are intereſſed in the war, receive? The King of <hi>England</hi> will be engaged, but of the ſame Religion; nor is there any thing more eaſie then when there is occaſion of perpetrating any wickedneſs, to palliate it with a pretext of a breach of the League. Hiſtories are fraughted with examples; in ſome there are no cautions ſufficient in ſuch a buſineſs: then to drive him where he cannot hurt, all other means are frail, and he which once believed is deſpiſed. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a conſideration of no leſs moment, that the <hi>Palatine</hi> being reſtored will draw all his power and policie; as hitherto, ſo hereafter, where he thinks he can do moſt hurt, and that moſt eaſily, to wit, to <hi>Bethlem-Gabor</hi> and the <hi>Turks,</hi> whom he hath already incited to hoſtility againſt me, and will never ceaſe hereafter to inſtigate the <hi>Galviniſts</hi> intire hopes in them. Theſe, untill they recover breath, and recollect their forces, they endeavour to diſarm and exhauſt me of monies, ranging in my ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories as they have done hitherto by fire and ſword. But if with them alſo, whom notwithſtanding I cannot truſt alike, I ſhould make peace, what conditions will <hi>Gabor</hi> who remains yet unconquered require, if I ſhould reſtore the <hi>Palatine</hi> (already conquered) to his Electoral dignity?</p>
            <p>Therefore ſince long before God granted me that famous victory, I firmly forecaſt with my ſelf, that the <hi>Palatine</hi> could not be reſtored to his Electoral dignity without the extreme danger of the Catholiques and my houſe, I offered freely on my own motion, but being directed queſtionleſs by God, the Electorſhip to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> a moſt eager Defender of the Catholique cauſe, whoſe territories on the other ſide lie as a Rampire between me and other Princes of <hi>Germany;</hi> and ſince I made ſo good uſe of his help, and ſo profitable in the recovery of my Kingdoms and Provinces, and continue yet to this day, time it ſelf more then the ſaid Duke doth cry out that I ſhould accompliſh my promiſe without further delay, and by tranſlation of the Electorſhip take away quite all hopes from the Palatine and them that ſollicite us ſo
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:125863:64"/>importunately for a reſtitution, that we may be freed from all moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which thing, ſince it needs the help of his Majeſty of <hi>Spain,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I know his Majeſty be propenſe enough of himſelf to all things which appertain to the honor of God, and the ſecurity of our Houſe, yet I thought good to admoniſh you of this occaſion, leſt this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of eſtabliſhing of our Religion and Family eſcape, which I conceive might conveniently be done by you. Neither do I ſuppoſe his Majeſty to be ignorant, that it was alwayes judged of our Anceſtors, that the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> which by Gods permiſſion doth now ſigniorize far and neer upon the earth, to have its chief foundation here in <hi>Germany,</hi> which is the more to be defended, the nearer its mine depends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. In times paſt this Houſe hath had proof of many adverſaries to its greatneſs, as the Hiſtories under <hi>Maximilian</hi> the firſt, <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Rodulf</hi> the ſecond do ſhew: the perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of <hi>Holland</hi> againſt his Majeſties Grandfather <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, fetcht her food from the Palatinate, neither can his Majeſty ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the rebellious <hi>Hollanders</hi> to obedience, unleſſe his root be pluckt up; which onely motive, beſides theſe which I alledged before, might juſtly induce him not to ſuffer a fallen enemy to riſe and reſume (as his ſtomack will never fail him) ſtrength again.</p>
            <p>But albeit it is not to be diſſembled that the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Princes, eſpecially the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> will not approve haply of this tranſlation, becauſe they fear it conduceth too much to the corroborating of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Cauſe: Nevertheleſs, ſince he cannot accuſe that act of <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, who for a far lighter cauſe deprived <hi>John Frederick</hi> of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorſhip, and confer'd it on <hi>Maurice</hi> this Dukes great Uncle; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that all the Councels of the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> do aim to bring in the Turk, he will not condemn his tranſlation: For no leſs is the <hi>Lutherans</hi> hatred againſt the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> as the Catholiques and they think leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger do proceed from the later. It is to be hoped therefore, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and other <hi>Lutheran Princes,</hi> when they ſee the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs brought to this point, will not ſo far diſapprove thereof, as to put themſelves in Arms; which I ſhall ſhortly underſtand of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Archduke <hi>Charls</hi> my brother, who is for this cauſe to treat with the Elector of <hi>Saxony.</hi> And theſe motives as they are of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ſo I imagine you, which are daily of his Majeſties Councell, have pondered them as diligently as my ſelf, and therefore that you will omit nothing that is pertinent to eſtabliſh this buſineſs, whereby we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the long and wiſhed fruit thereof, which is the propagation of the honor of Almighty God through the Empire, and the augmentation of the common ſafety, Family and Dignity.</p>

            <p>Moſt mighty and invincible Prince, Brother, Couſin, and ſpeciall lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Friend; It is not unknown unto the whole world, much leſs to your Imperiall Majeſty, how earneſtly we have hitherto ſought and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured as well by the diligence of our Ambeſſadors whom we have ſent, as by the interceſſion of the chief <hi>German</hi> Princes, the appeaſing of thoſe <hi>Bohemian</hi> wars ever ſince they firſt began, and with what ardent zeal and affection we have ſo much hunted after the deſire of peace: Let it not therefore ſeem ſtrange unto any man, that we take it ill, that all the very time when we were (to the uttermoſt of our power) trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of peace, and giving our beſt furtherance for the overture of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome means to effect it; even then notwithſtanding, we found clean contrary effects to enſue thereupon; whereat we much marvelled, ſeeing the Treaty was in hand, and already begun on all ſides: as namely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, that our ſon-in-law was wholly deſpoiled and robbed of his hereditary patrimony that remained unto him, excepting the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lower Palatinate, which was all by commandment of your Imperiall Majeſty, taken and poſſeſſed by the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> according as himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, with ſtrong hand and force of Arms, and that for ſuch reaſons as are meerly new, and ſuch as the like were never hitherto once heard of. That notwithſtanding it plainly appeareth by the anſwer given unto
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:125863:65"/>our Ambaſſador, that your Imperial Majeſty had cauſed the ſuſpenſion of that Ban or preſcription in thoſe Countries, yet did your Imperial Majeſty permit the taking of Arms again in hand: which alſo after the ſame your Imperial Majeſties anſwer, was yet again likewiſe commanded to be done in the Lower <hi>Palatinate,</hi> whereby there hath therein been ſince raiſed a grievous and cruel war, and moſt part of the Country taken in by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> powerfull ſtrength. But as we diligently obſerved thoſe things, we cleerly ſee what great trouble and miſery hath been oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by this our great patience and long delaying, forbearing and doubtfulneſs, which without all doubt may be hereafter further occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and which may perhaps prove heavier then the chief reaſons of this miſery it ſelf. And therefore we hold it beſt and moſt expedient that your Imperial Majeſty do at length put a period to this moſt unhappy buſineſs: And for that end and purpoſe have thought good at this time so propound what we preſcribe our Son in law on th'one part to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form towards your Imperial Majeſty, which we have always councelled and exhorted our Son in law to do, nor will we ſo much as in the leaſt once doubt of the contrary and adverſe ſucceſs therein, but are perſwaded that your Imperial Majeſty will be moſt graciouſly moved to receive our Son in law into grace and favour, to redeliver unto him his hereditary lands and titles which he had enjoyed before thoſe <hi>Bohemian</hi> wars, and fully to reſtore him to his former honours and dignities.

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:125863:65"/>Majeſties goodneſs and grace: which how well and acceptable it will be unto us, ſhall be acknowledged and ſhewed by our very willing ſervice and unfeigned friendſhip as well towards your Imperial Majeſty as towards the moſt renowned houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> But if it ſhall fall out contrary to our expectation, that theſe our juſt demands and well-willed preſentation ſhall not find acceptance, or after this our diligent endeavor you ſhall ſeek to delay us by the uſing ſome new tergiverſation, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to uſe that long councel and deliberate advice of the Princes of the Empire upon theſe our propounded conditions, whereas notwithſtanding your Imperial Majeſty expreſly promiſed in your laſt anſwer freely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what ſhould be your purpoſe and reſolution therein: So that there being no ground to the contrary (as we call God and the world to witneſs there is not) and being forced and conſtrained by the duty and natural affection which we owe and bear to our Children for the preſervation of their honour and welfare, we are reſolved to try the uttermoſt of our power for their relief; eſpecially ſeeing we ſue for, deſire, and would obtain and retain no new title of honour for our Son in law, but only to have again thoſe of his own now loſt, which he then had and enjoyed when we matched him with our dear and only daughter: For if in this diſtreſs we ſhould leave our Children and their Partiſans without councel help and protection, it would be a foul ſtain to our honour.</p>
            <p>Let not therefore your Imperial Majeſty in regard hereof blame us at all, if we with a mighty and puiſſant Army by force and ſtrong hand ſeek to recover that which by propounded and reaſonable conditions we could not obtain for the continuance of our friendſhip.

God almighty long preſerve your Imperial Majeſties life, and at laſt ſo direct your heart, that ſweet peace and the concord of all Chriſtendom now rent aſunder, may be recovered and again maintained.</p>

            <p>it may pleaſe your Majeſty to remember, that at my coming out of <hi>Spain</hi> I ſignified unto your Majeſty how far the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> had upon ſeverall occaſions intimated unto me an extraordinary deſire of this King and State, not onely to maintain peace and amity with your Majeſty, but to lay hold of all things that may be offered for the nearer uniting of your Majeſty and your Crowns; and that from this generality he had deſcended often to have diſcourſe with me of a match for the Princes Highneſs with the ſecond daughter of <hi>Spain,</hi> aſſuring me, that in this King and his Miniſters there was a forward diſpoſition thereunto. But from me he received no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer but to this effect, That I in the treaty of the former match for the late Prince, had received ſo ſtrange and unexpected anſwer from them, &amp; that their demands ſeemed ſo improper and unworthy, that I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that your Majeſty had little reaſon to be induced again to give eare to any ſuch overture, or that I ſhould again enter into any ſuch treaty, much leſs to be the motioner thereof: Although I would confeſs, that if I were fully perſwaded of the ſincerity of their intentions, and of a poſſibility of having the ſaid match effected, I know not any thing wherein I would more willingly imploy my endeavours; but as the caſe now ſtood, I was certain, that if I ſhould but make any ſuch motion in <hi>England,</hi> ſhould but draw imputation of much weakneſs upon me there, and no whit advance the cauſe, for that your Majeſty and your Miniſters would make no other conſtruction of the motion, but as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued to divert the Match of <hi>France;</hi> which was treated of, for that your Majeſty who but the year before had received ſo unpleaſing and unequal
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:125863:67"/>an anſwer, ſhould now be perſwaded that there was here ſo great a change, as that a match was really deſired, there would now need more then ordinary aſſurance. But the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> continuing ſeverall times the ſame profeſſion, and telling me beſides that the greateſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes might be altered by circumſtances, and that the Age of this Prince was much more proper then that of his brother; I freely let the Duke know that in caſe I might ſee that it was really deſired here, and that I might be able to propound unto my Maſter conditions of ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and certainty as might put him and his miniſters out of doubt that this overture was not again revived from hence either for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion or winning of time, I would then willingly intimate unto your Majeſty the inclination and deſire I found here of having a propoſition for this match once again ſet on foot. The Duke told me he would have a further conference with me, and that he then no ways doubted to give ſuch ſatisfaction as might well aſſure your Majeſty and your Miniſters, that they ſincerly deſired the match in generall, and would omit nothing on their ſide for the accomodating of particulars that might give furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance unto it. But the very night before the Duke had appointed a meeting with me, there came a Poſt diſpatcht out of <hi>England</hi> from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador upon the arrivall of Sir <hi>Thomas Edmonds</hi> into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who brought word that the match with <hi>France</hi> was abſolutely concluded, and that within few days it was to be publiſhed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Duke at our meeting the next morning, told me that it would be needleſs now to deſcend to any particulars in the buſineſs whereof we are to treat, ſince that they had newly received advertiſement that the match with <hi>France</hi> was fully concluded. And thus for the preſent the matter reſted untill ſome five or ſix weeks after; about which time my ſelf was to go into <hi>England,</hi> and ſo taking leave of the Duke, he asked me whether I had not received advertiſement that the match with <hi>France</hi> was publiſhed. I told him no, but I had certainly heard that it was not as yet fully concluded: Whreupon he intreated me, that in caſe I found not the <hi>French</hi> match in ſuch forwardneſs as it could not be ſtayed, I would let him know of it; and that if I ſhould ſee any kind of poſſibility that the buſineſs we had ſpoken of might be ſet on foot, I would advertiſe him, and that thereupon he would proceed to thoſe particulars which he formerly intended for my ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>Herewith I acquainted your Majeſty, and finding the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador in <hi>England</hi> had notice from the Duke of our former procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and order to further them by all poſſible means he could, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he ſhould underſtand that your Majeſty were not fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved of the <hi>French</hi> match, I thought it fit by this means to let the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:125863:67"/>Duke underſtand in what eſtate I found thoſe buſineſſes in <hi>England;</hi> and thereupon with your Majeſties permiſſion, I wrote a letter unto him to this effect.</p>
            <p>That although it were true that the Match with <hi>France</hi> had been treated of with much earneſtneſs on both ſides, and with great likelihood of being concluded; yet there daily aroſe ſo many difficulties, and new caſes of delay, that I judged it far from any perfect concluſion, neither did I ſee cauſe abſolutely to deſpair of the buſineſſes which our ſelves pretended, unleſs the difficulty of the Conditions ſhould make it deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. But if thoſe things ſhould be expected by <hi>Spain,</hi> which in the Treaty for the late Princeſs were demanded, it were better by much not to renew the buſineſs, then by impoſſible, or unfitting propoſitions on either ſide to give diſtaſte, or leſſen the friendſhip which now was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt your Majeſties. And therefore except that in <hi>Spain</hi> they would be contented with ſuch conditions as your Majeſty moſt fittingly and conveniently might yield unto, and all other Catholique Princes were willing to content themſelves with, I neither ſaw cauſe to hope for good ſucceſs, or reaſon to ſet the treaty on foot. But in caſe I might know that the conditions in point of Religion might be ſuch as I ſhould ſee a poſſibility of your Majeſties condeſcending unto them, I ſhould be far from deſpairing of ſome good effect; for that I knew that divers not of the meaneſt nor leaſt power with your Majeſty were hereunto well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, and would give their helping hands.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Spaniſh Ambaſſador diſpatcht his Secretary into <hi>Spain,</hi> and received anſwer from the Duke, that he ſhould give me all aſſurance that there was a great deſire and inclination to the making of the Match, and that at my return into <hi>Spain</hi> they no way doubted but that I ſhould receive ſuch ſatisfaction, as ſhould make it appear on their part there ſhould be nothing wanting for the effecting of it.</p>
            <p>It now remaineth what hath paſſed herein ſince my laſt coming to this Court. I arrived here in <hi>Madrid</hi> only a day or two before Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſs; and having ſome ſix dayes after my audience appointed by the King, whilſt I was in a withdrawing chamber expecting the Kings coming forth, the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> came thither to bear me company; and after many reſpectfull demands of your Majeſty, and the Queens and the Princes health, and ſome few complements unto my ſelf concerning my welcom again unto this Court, he fell to ſpeak of the falſe Alarms we had in <hi>England</hi> concerning a Spaniſh Armado, ſeeming much to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed that any credit ſhould be given to any thing to his Majeſties diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour and want of fidelity (as he termed it.) But your Majeſty (he ſaid) did never believe it: And it ſeems he heard of ſome pleaſant anſwer
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:125863:68"/>your Majeſty ſhould make to ſome one of your Miniſters, that in great haſte came unto your Majeſty when you were a hunting, and told you that the Spaniſh Fleet was in the Channel. From this he entred into great proteſtations of the ſincerity of this Kings affection and intention towards your Majeſty, telling me that I ſhould now ſee how much they deſired to work a greater neerneſs and uniting between your Majeſties: And that of the principal buſineſs of which we had in former time ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, meaning the Marriage, he deſired to ſpeak with me, but it muſt be at more leiſure. I anſwered, that I would not fail ſhortly to wait upon him, and that he ſhould find me anſwerable to the profeſſions I had made, which was, that being induced thereunto by ſuch ſufficient and good grounds as might ſatisfie my Maſter both for the convenience and fittingneſs of having ſuch a Treaty ſet on foot, and likewiſe might take away all objections of their intents of entertaining and diverting your Majeſty hereby, I would be as ready to do all good offices and give fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance to the buſineſs, as any Miniſter the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had. And this was all that at our firſt meeting paſſed in this buſineſs.</p>
            <p>About ſome eight days after, I having not in all this time ſtirred out of my houſe under colour of being ill diſpoſed, though the truth was indeed to inform my ſelf of ſome particulars which concerned your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties ſervice, before I would ſpeak with the Duke: He being (as I have ſince underſtood) ſomething troubled that in all this time I made no means to come unto him, one morning by nine of the clock very pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately came to my houſe, without advertiſing of his coming (as the cuſtom is here) untill the Coach ſtayed at my gate, and then he ſent in a Gentleman to me, telling me that the Duke was there to ſpeak with me. When I had conducted the Duke into a room where we were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, he fell into th'aforeſaid matter, and in the manner as I ſhall here ſet down unto your Majeſty, without making any other pretence or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of his coming, or without uſing in the ſpace of an houre any ſpeech touching any other buſineſs.</p>
            <p>After ſome few queſtions of your Majeſty and the Queen, he began to ask many things of the Prince, as of his age, his ſtature, his health, his inclination, to what ſports he was chiefly given? And then ſuddenly, as it were with a paſſionate expreſſion of affection, he deſired God to bleſs him, and to make him the means by which your Majeſties might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in a neerer alliance, and your Kingdoms in a perpetual amity: ſaying unto me, that he was out of doubt of my good inclination to this buſineſs, both by what had formerly paſſed between our ſelves, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by my proceedings in <hi>England,</hi> whereof he had been fully informed by the Spaniſh Ambaſſador. And therefore he would in few words deal
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:125863:68"/>with me with much cleerneſs and freeneſs, aſſuring himſelf he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the like meaſure from me; and thereupon entred into a ſolemn proteſtation, how much this King deſired the Match, and for himſelf he ſolemnly ſwore, there was no one thing in the world he more deſired to ſee before he dyed, then the effecting thereof. But my Lord Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador (ſaid he) you muſt deal as juſtly with me to let me underſtand whether you conceive the like deſire to be in the King of <hi>England</hi> and his Miniſters, and then I ſhall proceed to ſpeak further unto you.</p>
            <p>I anſwered the Duke, That I ever eſteemed more the reputation of a man of truth and integrity, then of skill and ſubtilty: which I did hope he did well perceive by what I was to ſay, for that I was much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous fairly to go off from this buſineſs, then eaſily to go into it. And therefore if he would have me ſpeak my conſcience, I neither conceived that either in your Majeſty or any of your Miniſters there was any kind of inclination thereunto; for that they having formerly given ſo reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and diſtaſtefull an anſwer, your Majeſty had juſt cauſe never again to caſt ſo much as your thoughts this way: And though it might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, that the fitneſs of the Prince his years, and other civil regards might cauſe new reſolutions, yet the difference of Religion were ſtill the ſame, and the ſame were the truths, and opinions of Divines in matter of conſcience; and therefore it would not but be a thing of great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to perſwade your Majeſty and your Miniſters that a Match ſhould be hearkened unto, much leſs deſired from hence, but upon the ſame terms the very thought and remembrance whereof is yet unpleaſing in <hi>England.</hi> So that to deal plainly with him, I neither found in your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty or in the Councel any kind of thought or imagination of any poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of having any ſuch motion again revived. But this I found not to grow from any particular diſlike or want of affection in your Majeſty to <hi>Spain,</hi> or that many of the greateſt or the principalleſt perſon in <hi>England</hi> judged not the neerneſs and alliance of <hi>Spain</hi> equally valuable with any other of Chriſtendom; but that out of a diſtaſtefulneſs of the former anſwer given from hence, all expectation of any buſineſs of this nature was abſolutely extinguiſhed, and therefore again to revive it there would need more then ordinary endeavours or ordinary aſſurances: But in caſe that they might be given, I know that this Match would neither want well-willers nor aſſiſtants; and for my own part I would freely make profeſſion that no man more deſired it then my ſelf, nor would more willingly imploy his endeavours for the furthering thereof, when by the deſcending to particulars I ſhould ſee both in regard of the conditions and the aſſurances of ſincere proceeding, the motion worthy and fit by a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:125863:69"/>diſcreet and good ſervant to be offered to his Maſter; neither then ſhould I be wholly out of hope of good ſucceſs, though I would not but eſteem it a buſineſs of infinite difficulty.</p>
            <p>The Duke replied, That any diſcourſe that I thought fit herein ſhould be condeſcended unto, for that all time was loſt that was ſpent in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities: And therefore if I ſo liked, he would move this King, that one or two beſides himſelf might be appointed to have conference with me; for that if he ſhould only retain it in his hands, by reaſon of his many occupations it would have a ſlower progreſs then he wiſhed; but if I would by way of conference digeſt the difficulties into heads and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, he would as often as he might be preſent at our meeting: But for his own part, he ſaid he apprehended few but what would ariſe out of the difference of Religion.</p>
            <p>I told the Duke, that I very well approved of the deſcending into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, neither ſhould I refuſe conference with any herein whom the King would appoint to ſpeak with me: But if his meaning were, that theſe perſons ſhould be nominated or joyned by way of Commiſſion, I thought fit to let him underſtand that I neither had any time, nor did at preſent ſpeak of this buſineſs either by order or direction, no nor ſo much as by your Majeſties privity, but as a Miniſter that deſired to lay hold of all occaſions for the increaſing of further love &amp; neerneſs betwixt his Maſter and the Prince to whom he is imployed, I ſhould be glad to the uttermoſt of my power to advance and further this cauſe, as that which I apprehended to be the greateſt which the world now affordeth for the firm uniting of your Majeſties and your eſtates.</p>
            <p>The Duke told me, that the King would make no ſcruple to declare his good inclination and deſire to have this Match proceeded in; and that for the accommodating of the difficulties, he had already uſed divers diligences with the Pope, as likewiſe with the greateſt Divines of this Kingdom, whereof he named ſome unto me, whom he ſaid he found very well inclined to the Match: he told me alſo he would be glad they might ſpeak with me, to the end I might truly underſtand of them all kind of ſcruples that could be alleadged. I anſwered, I deſired nothing more; and that I could not but approve of thoſe courſes he preſcribed, as the moſt probable to produce a good effect, and that I hoped God would give happy ſucceſs unto the buſineſs: But I ſhould be bold in one thing to deliver my opinion, which was, No wayes to intereſs our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters herein, unleſs by the underſtanding and cleering the difficulties on both ſides, there ſhould be great appearances and probabilities that the buſineſs would take effect: For if their names ſhould be herein uſed, and after their Treaty ſhould not be ſucceſsfull, it would but exaſperate and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:125863:69"/>breed a greater diſtaſte betwixt your Majeſties. The Duke told me, he himſelf miſliked not my opinion; though he ſaid that howſoever that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs ſucceeded, yet your Majeſty ſhould have reaſon to accept kindly this Kings good intention, for that if it miſcarried, it ſhould appear not to be their default, but that they had ſtretched as far as honor and conſcience would give them leave. And thus much he ſaid I might write unto your Majeſty if I thought fit, or to my confident friends in <hi>England</hi> upon his word and aſſurance: and ſo telling me that he would preſently appoint thoſe that ſhould confer with me in this buſineſs, we then parted.</p>
            <p>Within two days after I went to the Duke, and after that I had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with him about the buſineſs of <hi>Cleves</hi> according to my inſtruction, whereof I gave an account unto Mr. Secretary in a diſpatch directed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, we fell again into the ſpeech of the match.</p>
            <p>The Duke told me had well conſidered of that which I had ſaid unto him, and much approved it, not to intereſt our Matters in the buſineſs, until we ſhould ſee ſome likelihood of good ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>And for that he ſuppoſed the difference of Religion like to prove the onely difficulty of conſideration, he thought it fit that it ſhould be firſt cleared; and therefore he would break the matter with the Cardinall of <hi>Toledo,</hi> &amp; the Kings Confeſſor, and with them he joyned another learned man, one Father <hi>Frederick,</hi> who ſince I underſtand is a Jeſuite, but truly hath the report of a moderate man. Theſe the Duke ſaid ſhould have order to confer with me as far as might be, reſerving ſafe the grounds and ſincerity of their Religion. I anſwered the Duke, that I was well ſatisfied herewith, and that if their demands were ſuch as might content any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Catholique Prince, I ſhould have hope of good ſucceſs; if otherwiſe, I ſhould judge it a happineſs to be put out of doubt and ſuſpence, and ſo we paſſed from this ſubject.</p>
            <p>I preſume to ſet down to your Majeſty all the paſſages of this buſineſs with ſo much length and fulneſs for that I no way dare adventure to offer unto your Majeſty any opinion or belief of my own, either for the fitneſs of the match, or the ſincerity of their intention, or the poſſibility of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating differences of Religion. But your Majeſty ſeeing undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed all that hath hitherto paſſed, with every circumſtance, may be pleaſed out of the conſideration and knowledg of thoſe particulars to frame unto your ſelf both ſuch a beliefe of their direct meaning, and ſuch a reſolution of the further proceeding herein, as ſhall be moſt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your Majeſties wiſdom: onely I think it fit to ſet down further unto your Majeſty the particular ends which may be conceived they aim at by ſetting this buſineſs afoot at this preſent, in caſe they ſhould not
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:125863:70"/>intend really to perform it: The firſt may be to ſtagger and divert your Majeſties Treaty with <hi>France:</hi> The ſecond for entertaining your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty with fair hopes and promiſes, thereby to keep you from declaring your ſelf oppoſite unto them in the preſent buſineſs of <hi>Juliers</hi> and <hi>Cleves</hi> which remaineth ſtill uncompounded. But this being ſo, your Majeſty may be pleaſed to underſtand that they ſerve themſelves with this occaſion, not that there could be any ſuch thing primarily in their intention, for that the expreſſion of their deſire to the match was the laſt year long before theſe differences happened.</p>
            <p>Further, the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> ſhould be the moſt falſ and diſhonorable man living, without Chriſtianity or ſoul, if he ſhould voluntarily damn himſelf with oathes and proteſtations of a thing that he ſincerely meant not; and truly he ſhould deal contrarily to the wiſdom of his other proceedings, wherein he layeth all occaſions of diſtaſte or diſcourteſie upon other inferior Miniſters, labouring ſtill to clear himſelf of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of them, if in this he ſhould make himſelf the author and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of ſo unjuſt and indirect proceeding between Princes. But the courſe of moſt ſecurity and caution is, that your Majeſty ſuffer none of your other reſolutions to be interrupted by this overture; onely if your Majeſty be pleaſed for a while to entertain and ſuſpend the concluſion of the match with <hi>France,</hi> I conceive it can be little to your Majeſties diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>It laſtly now remaineth, that I become an humble ſuiter unto your Majeſty for your clear and full directions in this buſineſs, deſiring if your Majeſty will have it further entertained, that I may have ample in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions from your Majeſty, both that I may intimate what may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in point of Dowry, and in all other things to be required by your Majeſty, as likewiſe how far I may proceed in ſatisfying in point or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For it is not to be ſuppoſed that they wil proceed with that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and directneſs which is to be wiſhed, unleſs in a fitting meaſure they ſhall ſee me likewiſe able and willing to declare my ſelf in ſuch. points wherein they may expect ſatisfaction. I intend not hereby to move for a formall Commiſſion to treat, but onely a private inſtruction for my direction and warrant how to behave my ſelf as may be moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to the cauſe, and your Majeſties ends. So humbly deſiring your Majeſty to command this Bearer to be diſpatched back with all conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ſpeed, I commend your Majeſty to the holy protection of God.</p>

               <hi>Abignoto</hi> to Conde <hi>Gondomar,</hi> concerning the death of <hi>Philip</hi> the third.</head>
            <p>VPon the laſt day of <hi>February,</hi> being <hi>Sunday,</hi> 1620. his Catholique Majeſty, after he had heard Maſs and the Sermon in the Chappel, was taken with a Feaver, which continued with him eight dayes with a ruddineſs and pimples which appeared plainly in his face, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards began to diminiſh: but he was ſuddenly taken with a vomiting and a great feaver, which continued with him till the 21. day; and the Phyſitians were of opinion to have him riſe out of his bed, which was accordingly done both that day and the next: but about dinner-time happened unto him a great ſwouning, which much aſtoniſht him; and the 23. day, in the night, his feaver did redouble upon him with a vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a flux in the belly, and a great melancholy and an opinion that he ſhould die: which feaver continued with divers reduplications, the Phyſitians having an ill opinion of him till on Saturday night the 27. when his reduplications were more violent, his water bad; and the King perſevered in ſaying how he ſaw well that he ſhould die, he commanded that the Image of our Lady of <hi>Antiochia</hi> ſhould be carried about, which was performed on Sunday the 28. in a ſolemn Proceſſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Councilors of <hi>Spain</hi> aſſiſted.</p>
            <p>In the evening commandment was given to the Churches, that the bleſſed Sacrament ſhould be ſet upon the Altar, and the body of S. <hi>Iſidore</hi> ſhould be placed in the Court. On Munday the 29. about four of the clock in the evening, his diſeaſe then grew violent, and ſome ulcers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on his belly, on his reins, and on his thighs; and the King ſtill aſſuring himſelf that he ſhould die, the Phyſitians then feeling his pulſe affirmed that undoubtedly they aſſented unto the King in the opinion he conceived of his infirmity. At the ſame time the Preſident of <hi>Caſtile</hi> was ſent for, and the Confeſſor, who having had ſome ſpeech with the King and the Duke of <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> they went and fetcht the Councellors, before whom and the Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> who were preſent, the King ſealed his Teſtament, which <hi>John de Serita</hi> Secretary of State had ſet down in writing in his preſence. Afterwards they cauſed him to eat ſomewhat; and being adviſed how it would be good for him to ſleep, he made this anſwer in Spaniſh, <hi>En jornada tan longa y tiempe tan bréve ne conviéus repoſar;</hi> Upon ſo long a journey, and ſo ſhort a time to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:125863:71"/>it, I muſt not reſt. Then he ſent for the Prince, and the young Child <hi>Don Carlo,</hi> to whom having ſpoken for a good while, at length in particular to the Prince he ſaid aloud how he recommended unto him the Child, and that he grieved that he ſhould have been unprovided, but he hoped he left him in the hands of a good &amp; loving brother. Then ſaid he to the Prince, that he requeſted him that he would not do as he did at his coming to the Crown, in removing his Fathers old Officers and Servants, but that he would imploy thoſe who were experienced in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Commonwealth: he then commended unto him particularly <hi>John de Luenza</hi> Secretary of the Memorials, and his Confeſſor, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Duke of <hi>Oſſuna.</hi> Then was preſently brought in the Infanta <hi>Maria,</hi> and the Infante-Cardinal. He cryed out when he ſaw the Infanta and ſaid, <hi>Maria,</hi> I am full ſorry that I muſt die before I have married thee; but this thy brother ſhall have care of. He then turned towards her brother, and ſaid unto him, Prince, do not forſake her till you have made her an Empreſs. Then he ſpake unto the Cardinal Infant, whom he appointed to be a Prieſt ſo ſoon as he ſhould come to be of fit age, and ſaid that he ſhould be much grieved if he thought he would not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this profeſſion. He had ſent for Madam the Princeſs, but ſhe ſwoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon her entry at the chamber-door, which was the cauſe that ſhe was conducted back again unto her own chamber, fearing leſt it might be prejudicial unto her being great with child. Which being reported to the King, he ſhewed great compaſſion thereat, and ſaid that he ever conſtantly believed that Madam the Princeſs loved him as well as any of his own children. After that he began to ſpeak of the Queen, ſaying how ſhe ſhould loſe a good Husband, and that he had always loved her dearly. Afterwards he diſtributed between the Prince and the Infanta the Reliques and other memorials he had, except one Crucifix which hung at the teſtern of the bed, and ſaid unto the Prince that he could not give it him then, becauſe was the ſame with which his Grandfather and Father had dyed; but he commended it to him to be held with great reverence after his death, and that the Popes had given unto it ſpecial Indulgences. Afterwards giving them all his bleſſing, he cauſed them to go forth; and ſo calling for the bleſſed Sacrament, which was admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred unto him about midnight, he received the Extreme unction at two of the clock in the morning, and ſo commended himſelf unto God. Yet did he not for all this forbear to ſeal to a great number of papers which were brought him: And complaining very much, he refuſed ſuch meat as they would have had him take. About noon the Body of St. <hi>Iſidore</hi> was placed neer unto his bed, his Confeſſor and Father <hi>Florence</hi> perſwading him to make a vow for his health, and that he would build a
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:125863:71"/>Chappel to the ſame Saint, which he did, but withall ſaid, <hi>Peró ya es táde,</hi> But now it is very late. He continued all the reſt of the day ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually to the Father Confeſſor, Father <hi>Florence,</hi> and <hi>Rochas.</hi> Many proceſſions of penance were ſolemnized in the Town, and the Councel aſſembled twice. About the evening his infirmity renewed with violence, and having languiſhed the whole night, in the morning his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture was publiſhed, though indeed it was not till about nine of the clock in the morning, the laſt of <hi>March,</hi> the ſelf ſame day of our return. Which will inform you of all things paſſed, at leaſt of ſuch as came any ways to our knowledge. The Queen ſtir'd not out of her bed all that day, for fear leſt either trouble or grief of mind (whereof ſhe gave plentiful teſtimony by her tears) might prejudice her health, or the fruit of her body, which ſhe hath paſſed over (thanks be to God) whereof we ſend you word, that the good news may ſhut up the diſcourſe of an accident ſo lamentable and unlooked for.</p>

            <p>THere is none knowes better then your ſelf how we have laboured ever ſince the beginning of theſe infortunate troubles of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, notwithſtanding all oppoſition to the contrary, to merit well of our good brother the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the whole Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> by a long and lingring patience grounded ſtill upon his friendſhip and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, That care ſhould be had of our honour, and of our Childrens pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony and inheritance. We have acquainted you alſo from time to time ſince the beginning of the Treaty at <hi>Bruxels</hi> how croſsly things have there proceeded, notwithſtanding the fair profeſſions made unto us both by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Infanta &amp; all his Miniſters, and the Letters written by him unto the Emperor, and them effectually (at the leaſt as they endeavoured to make us believe) but what fruits have we of all theſe, other then diſhonour andd ſcorn? Whilſt we are treating, the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Heidilbergh</hi> taken by force, our Garriſon put to the ſword, <hi>Manheim</hi> beſieged, and all the hoſtility uſed that is within the power of an Enemy, as you will ſee by the relation which we have commanded our Secretary to ſend you.</p>

            <p>Our pleaſure therefore is, That you ſhall immediatly as ſoon as you can get audience, let the King underſtand how ſenſible we are of thoſe proceedings of the Emperour towards us; and withall are not a little troubled to ſee that the <hi>Infanta</hi> having an abſolute commiſſion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a ſuſpenſion and ceſſation of Arms, ſhould now at laſt when all objections were anſwered, and the former (ſolely pretended) obſtacles removed, not onely delay the concluſion of the Treaty, but refuſe to lay her command upon the Emperours Generals for abſtaining from the ſiege of our Garriſons during the Treaty upon pretext of want of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. So as for avoyding of further diſhonor, we have been enforced to recall both our Ambaſſadors, as well the Chancellor of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer (who is already returned to our preſence) as alſo the Lord <hi>Chiche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> whom we intended to have ſent unto the Emperour to the Dyet at <hi>Ratisbone.</hi> Seeing therefore that out of our extraordinary reſpect meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the firm confidence we ever put in the hopes and promiſes which he did give us, deſiring nothing more then for his cauſe principally to avoid all occaſions that might put us into ill under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding with any of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> We have hitherto procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a ſtedfaſt patience truſting to the treaties, and neglecting all other means which might probably have ſecured the remainder of our childrens inheritance. Thoſe Garriſons which we maintained in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate, being rather for honor ſake to keep a footing untill the generall accommodation, then that we did rely ſo much upon their ſtrength as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his frienpſhip, and by the confidence &amp; ſecurity of ours are thus expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to diſhonor &amp; reproach: you ſhal tell that King, that ſeeing all thoſe endeavours and good offices which he hath uſed towards the Emperour in this buſineſs, on the behalf of our ſon-in-law, upon confidence whereof that our ſecurity depended, which he continually by his Letters and Miniſters here laboured to beget and confirm in us, have not ſorted to any other iſſue then to a plain abuſe both of his truſt and ours; whereby we are both of us highly injured in our honour, though in a different degree we hope, &amp; deſire that out of a true ſenſe of this wrong offered unto us, he will as our deer and loving brother faithfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and undertake upon his honor, confirming the ſame alſo under his hand and ſeal, either that the Caſtle and Town of <hi>Heidelbergh</hi> ſhall within threeſcore and ten dayes after this your audience, and demand made, be rendred into our hands, with all things therein belonging, to our ſon-in-law, or our daughter, as neer as may be, in the ſtate wheirn they were taken; and the like for <hi>Manheim</hi> and <hi>Frankindale,</hi> if both or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the of them ſhall be taken by the enemy whilſt theſe things are in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as alſo that there ſhall be within the ſaid term of threeſcore and ten

Or if ſo be his forces at this preſent be otherwiſe ſo imployed, as that they cannot give us that aſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtance which we here deſire, and as we think we have deſerved, yet at the leaſt he will permit us a free and friendly paſſage through his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories and Dominions for ſuch forces as we ſhall ſend and imploy into <hi>Germany</hi> for this ſervice: of all which disjunctively, if you receive not of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> within ten days at the furtheſt, after your audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and propoſition made, a direct aſſurance under his hand and ſeal, without delay or putting us off to further Treaties and Conferences, that is to ſay, of ſuch reſtitution, ceſſation of Arms, and proceeding to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall treaty, as is before mentioned, or elſe of aſſiſtance and joyning his forces with ours againſt the Emperour, or at leaſt permiſſion of paſſage for our forces through his ſaid Dominions, that then you take your leave and return unto our Preſence without further ſtay; otherwiſe to proceed in the negotiation of the marriage of our Son, according to the inſtruction we have given you.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I received your Majeſties Letter of the 9. of <hi>Septemb</hi> the 23. of the ſame moneth, &amp; by them underſtand that your Majeſty hath received much ſatisfaction by what I had formerly written unto your Majeſty both concerning the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the concluſion of the Match: but that your Majeſty findeth the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects very unſuitable, both by the proceeding at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> &amp; in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate,</hi> as alſo by what you underſtand from <hi>Rome</hi> by Mr. <hi>Gage</hi> of the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:125863:73"/>Popes demands. I hope by the arrival of Mr. <hi>Cottington</hi> your Majeſty will have received ſatisfaction in ſome meaſure, at leaſt that there hath been no diligence or time omitted either for the redreſſing of any thing that hath been amiſs, or for the advancing of your Majeſties affairs.</p>
            <p>The very day I received your Letters, I ſent a Gentleman poſt unto the King who was gone into the Eſcurial, to demand audience, which he preſently granted me, and I repaired thither unto him upon the third of <hi>October,</hi> the Conde <hi>de Gondomar</hi> being likewiſe commanded to wait upon the King, I was there well received; and preſently upon my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival the Conde <hi>de Olivarez</hi> came to me to the lodgings which were appointed for me to reſt in. To him I delivered fully in the preſence of Sir <hi>Walter Aſhton</hi> and the Conde <hi>de Gondomar,</hi> what I had to negotiate with the King, both in the buſineſs of the Match, and of the Palatinate. In the Match I repreſented how much it imported your Majeſty that a ſpeedy reſolution might be taken therein, both in regard of the Prince being your Majeſties onely ſon, now arrived to the age of 22 years, and for the ſetling of your affairs in <hi>England.</hi> I repeated unto him all the paſſages in this Treaty, how many years had been already ſpent in it; that after ſo long an expectation, the diligences uſed in <hi>Rome</hi> for the obtaining of the Diſpenſation had wrought but ſmall effect, ſince the Pope had lately made ſuch demands as were altogether impoſſible for your Majeſty to condeſcend unto; and therefore your Majeſty ſeeing the buſineſs ſtill delayed, held it fit that ſome ſuch courſe might be taken that both your Majeſties might ſpeedily know what you were to truſt unto; and therfore had comanded me to ſignifie unto this King your uttermoſt reſolution how far you would condeſcend in point of Religion towards what the Pope had demanded; &amp; if herewith this King could be ſatisfied, your Maj. deſire that we might proceed to a final and ſpeedy concluſion; otherwiſe that this King would likewiſe cleerly declare himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that your Majeſty might loſe no more time in the diſpoſing of the Prince your ſon. Hereunto the <hi>Conde de Olivarez</hi> anſwer'd with ſome length, the ſubſtance I ſhall only preſume to ſet down briefly to your Majeſty. He propoſed a ſincere intention and reſolution in the King to make the Match, and that there ſhould not be one day loſt; for the ſpeedy diſpatch thereof imported them as much as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your Majeſty; and to the end that no time may be loſt, this King had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the next day after for Don <hi>Balthazar de Zuniga</hi> appointed Don <hi>Ferdinando de Giron</hi> in his place in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: That for the going of Mr. <hi>Gage</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Popes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, they were abſolutely ignorant of them; That the King had done all that I my ſelf deſired for the redreſs of this error: That I might aſſure your Majeſty that you ſhall find all ſincerity and cleer proceeding, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any houres delay more then of neceſſity the nature of the buſineſs required.</p>
            <pb n="131" facs="tcp:125863:73"/>
            <p>As for the buſiness of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> I preſented at large the merits of your Majeſties proceeding, the many promiſes made from hence; yet notwithſtanding the whilſt your Majeſty was treating at <hi>Bruxels, Heidelberg</hi> one of the three places which were only left, and where your Majeſty had Garriſons, was beſieged by the Archduke <hi>Leopold</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Tilly;</hi> that this King had withdrawn his Forces, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the <hi>Palatinate</hi> abſolutely to the Emperor and the Duke of <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi> The Conde <hi>de Olivarez</hi> anſwered me, by acknowledging how much your Majeſties proceedings had deſerved at the Emperor and this Kings hands: That whatſoever your Majeſty could expect, or had been at any time promiſed, ſhould by this King be really performed: That the Prince Palatines own courſes hitherto had been the only hinderance of the effecting of it: That he referred it unto your Majeſties own juſt judgment, whether the calling of this Kings forces out of the Palatinate were with any ill intention, or meerly for the defence of <hi>Flanders,</hi> which otherwiſe had been put in great hazard by Count <hi>Mansfield,</hi> as your Majeſty ſaw by what had really paſſed: That the ſiege of <hi>Heidelbergh</hi> was no way by the conſent or knowledge of this King or any of his Miniſters but was generally diſapproved by them all.</p>
            <p>I told them, I conceived that was not enough; for that your Majeſty had engaged your ſelf to this King, that in caſe your Son-in-law would not conform himſelf, you would not only forſake him, but would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare your ſelf againſt him, and give the Emperor aſſiſtance for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of him to reaſon, and that your Majeſty could not but expect a like reciprocal proceeding from the King. He anſwered, your Majeſty ſhould ſee the Kings ſincerity by the effects; and that if <hi>Heidelbergh</hi> ſhould be taken, and the Emperor refuſe to reſtore it, or to condeſcend to ſuch accommodation as ſhould be held reaſonable, this King would infallibly aſſiſt your Majeſty with his Forces. And this he ſpake with great aſſurance, and wiſhed me to deſire your Majeſty to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent you would find nothing but real and ſinc ere proceedings from hence.</p>
            <p>I was then preſently called for to the King, to whom I ſpake firſt in the buſineſs of the Match, and delivered him the contents thereof in writing, which I have ſent to Mr. Secretary. I received from him the ſame anſwer in effect as from the Conde <hi>de Olivarez,</hi> That he deſired the Match no leſs then your Majeſty; That on his part there ſhould be no time loſt for the bringing of it to a ſpeedy concluſion. In the buſineſs of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> I ſpake unto the King with ſome length, repeating many particulars of your Majeſties proceedings, and how much your honour was like to ſuffer, that now whilſt you were treating, <hi>Heidelborgh</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:125863:74"/>defended by your Garriſons, was like to be taken. The King anſwered me, He would effectually labour that your Majeſty ſhould have entire ſatisfaction; and rather then your Majeſty ſhould fail thereof, he would imploy his Arms to effect it for you. My Lord Ambaſſador Sir <hi>Walter Aſhton</hi> accompanied me at my audience, and was a witneſs of all that paſſed as wel with the King, as with the Conde <hi>de Olivarez.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Within few dayes after the newes of the taking of <hi>Heidelbergh</hi> came hither: whereupon I diſpatched again to the King in ſuch ſort as I have at large advertiſed Mr. Secretary <hi>Calvert.</hi> The effect of my Negotiation was, that they on the 13. of <hi>October</hi> diſpatched Letters away of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors and Duke of <hi>Bavaria's</hi> proceedings. But preſſing them further in regard their former Letters have wrought ſo little effect, they have given me at preſent a ſecond Diſpatch, which I have ſent unto the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta,</hi> and whereof Mr. Secretary will give your Majeſty an account, which I conceive will procure your Majeſties better ſatisfaction then hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto you have received from the Emperor and his party.</p>
            <p>For the buſineſs of the match, I have written to Mr. Secretary what is to be ſaid at preſent; and will only add, that as I ſhould not willingly give your Majeſty hope upon uncertain grounds, ſo I will not conceal what they profeſs, which is, That they will give your Majeſty real and ſpeedy ſatisfaction therein. And if they intended it not, they are falſer then all the Devils in hell; for deeper oaths and proteſtations of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity cannot be made.</p>
            <p>It will only remain, that I humbly caſt my ſelf at your Majeſties feet for that addition of Title wherewith it hath pleaſed you to honour me and my poſterity. My gratitude and thankfulneſs wanteth expreſſion, and ſhall only ſay unto your Majeſty, That as all I have either of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes or honour, I hold it meerly of your bounty and goodneſs; ſo ſhall I ever cheerfully lay them down with my life into the bargain, for the ſervice of your Majeſty and yours.</p>
            <p>So with my humble prayers for the health and proſperity of your Majeſty, I humbly commend your Majeſty to Gods holy protection, and reſt,</p>

            <salute>Sir,</salute>
            <p>COnſidering in what eſtate we find the Treaty of marriage between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Emgland,</hi> and knowing certainly how the Miniſters did underſtanding this buſineſs, that treated it in the time of <hi>Philip</hi> the third, who is now in heaven, that their meaning was never to effect it; but by enlarging the treaties and points of the ſaid marriage, to make uſe of the friendſhip of the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> as well in the matter of <hi>Germany</hi> as thoſe of <hi>Flanders;</hi> and ſuſpecting likewiſe that your Majeſty is of the ſame opinion (although the demonſtrations do not ſhew ſo) joining to thoſe ſuſpitions that it is certain that the <hi>Infanta Donna Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> is reſolved to put her ſelf into the Monaſtery the ſame day that your Majeſty ſhall preſs her to make the marriage, I have thought fit to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to your Majeſty that which my good zeal hath afforded me in this occaſion, thinking it a good time to acquaint your Majeſty withal, to the end you may reſolve of that which you ſhall find moſt convenient with the advice of thoſe Miniſters that you ſhall think fit.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> doth find himſelf at this time equally in the two buſineſſes, the one is the marriage to the which he is moved by the conveniences which he finds in your Majeſties friendſhip with making an agreement with thoſe Catholiques that he thinks are ſecretly in his Kingdom, and by this to aſſure himſelf of them, as likewiſe to marry
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:125863:75"/>his ſon to one of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> knowing that the <hi>Infanta Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Maria</hi> is the beſt born Lady in the world. Th'other buſineſſe is, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Palatinate, in which he is yet more ingaged. For (beſides that his reputation is at ſtake there is added) the love and intereſt of his Grandchildren, ſons of his onely daughter. So that both by the law of Nature, and reaſon of State, he ought to put them before whatſoever conveniences might follow by diſſembling what they ſuffer. I do not diſpute whether the King of <hi>Great Britainy</hi> be governed in this buſineſs of the Palatinate by Art or friendſhip, I think a man may ſay he hath uſed both; but as a thing not preciſely neceſſary to this diſcourſe, I omit it. I hold it for a maxime, that theſe two Ingagements in which he finds himſelf, are unſeparable: for although the marriage be made, we muſt fail in that which in any way of underſtanding is moſt neceſſary, which is the reſtitution of the Palatinate. This being ſuppoſed, having made the marriage in the form as it is treated, your Majeſty may find your ſelf, together with the King of <hi>Great Brirain,</hi> engaged in a war againſt the Emperour, and the Catholique league, ſo that your Majeſty ſhall be forced to delare your ſelf with your Arms againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and the Catholique league, a thing which to hear will offend your Majeſties godly ears: or declaring your ſelf for the Emperour and the Catholique league as certainly you will, your Majeſty will find your ſelf ingaged in a war againſt the King of <hi>England,</hi> and your ſiſter married with his ſon, with the which all whatſoever conveniences that was thought upon with this marriage do ceaſe if your Majeſty ſhall ſhew your ſelf Newtrall as it may be ſome will expound —</p>
            <p>The firſt will cauſe very great ſcandall, and with juſt reaſon, ſince in matters of leſſe oppoſition then of Catholiques againſt Heretiques, the Armes of this Crown hath taken the godly againſt the contrary part. And at this time the <hi>French</hi> men have taken part with the <hi>Hollanders</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your Majeſty, your piety hath been ſuch, that you have ſent your Arms againſt the Rebels of that Crown, leaving all the great conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of State, only becauſe thoſe men are enemies of the faith and the Church. It wil oblige your Majeſty, and good occaſion to thoſe of the League, to make uſe of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and other Catholique Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ill affected to this Crown, for it will be a thing neceſſary for them to do ſo, and thoſe even againſt their own Religion will foment and aſſiſt the Heret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ques for hatred to us, without doubt they will follow the contrary part onely to leave your Majeſty with that blemiſh that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath befaln any King of theſe Dominions.</p>
            <p>By the ſecond the King of <hi>England</hi> will remain offended and diſobliged, ſeeing that neither intereſſes nor hopes do follow the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:125863:75"/>Allyance with this Crown, as likewiſe the pretext of particular reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for having ſuffered his daughter and grand-children to be ruined for reſpect of the ſaid Allyance. The Emperour, though he be well-affected, and obliged to us in making the tranſlation at this time as buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes now ſtand (the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> being now poſſeſſed of all the Dominions) although he would diſpoſe all according to our convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet it will not be in his power to do it, as you and every body may ſee: And the memoriall that the Emperours Ambaſſador gave your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty yeſterday, makes it certain, ſince in the Liſt of the Souldiers, that every on of the League is to pay, he ſhews your Majeſty, that <hi>Bavier</hi> for himſelf alone will pay more then all the reſt joyned together; the which doth ſhew his power and his intention, which is not to accommodate matters, but to keep to himſelf the ſuperiority of all in this broken time. The Emperour is now in the Dyet, and the tranſlation is to be made in it. The oppoſition in this eſtate is, by conſerving the means for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, which your Majeſties Miniſters will do with their capacities, zeal and wiſdom, and it is certain they wil all have enough to do; for the difficulty conſiſts to find a way to make the preſent eſtate of affairs ſtraight again, which with lingring, as it is ſaid, both the power and time will be loſt. I ſuppoſe that the Emperour, as your Majeſty knows by his Ambaſſador, deſires to marry his daughter with the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> ſon, I doubt not but he will be likewiſe glad to marry his ſecond daughter with the Palatines ſon.</p>
            <p>Then I propound, that theſe two marriages be made, and that they be ſet on foot preſently, giving the King of <hi>England</hi> full ſatisfaction in all his propoſitions for the more ſtrict union and correſpondency that he may agree to it: I hold for certain, that all the conveniences that would have followed the allyance with us, wil be as full in this, it doth accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the matter of the Palatinate, and the ſucceſſion of his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children with his honor, &amp; without drawing a ſword, or waſting treaſure.</p>
            <p>After I would reduce the Prince Elector, that was an enemy, to the obedience of the Church, by breeding his ſons in the Emperours Court, with Catholique Doctrine.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs is great, the difficulty greater then perchance have been in any other caſe, I have found my ſelf obliged to repreſent to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and to ſhew (if you pleaſe to command me) what I think fit for the diſpoſing of the things, and of the great Miniſters that your Majeſty hath; I hope with the particular notice of theſe things, (and all being helped with the good zeal of the <hi>Conde de Gondemer</hi>) it may be that God wil open a way to it, a thing ſo much for his and your Majeſties ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>

            <p>I have received your Majeſties Letters of the 8. of <hi>October</hi> on the 21. of the ſame moneth, ſome houres within night; and have thought fit to diſpatch back unto your Majeſty with all poſſible ſpeed, referring the anſwer to what your Majeſty hath by theſe Letters commanded me, to a Poſt that I ſhall purpoſely diſpatch when I ſhall have negotiated the particulars with this King and his Miniſters, wherein God willing all poſſible dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſhall be uſed.</p>
            <p>But foraſmuch as I find both by your Majeſties Letter, as likewiſe by Letters which I have received from the Prince his Highneſs, that you continue your deſires of having the Match proceeded in, I held it my duty that your Majeſty ſhould be informed that although I am ſet free in as much as concerneth the doubt of the <hi>Infanta's</hi> entring into Religion, new direction I now received from your Majeſty, that the Depoſories ſhould be deferr'd till <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> the ſaid powers are made altogether uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and invalid, it being a clauſe in the bodies of the ſaid powers, that they ſhall onely remain in force till <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> and no longer, as your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty may ſee by the copie I ſend herewith incloſed.</p>
            <pb n="138" facs="tcp:125863:77"/>
            <p>Your Majeſty, I conceive, will be of opinion, that the ſuſpending of the execution of the powers untill the force and validity of them be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, is a direct and effeftuall revoking of them; which not to do, how far his Highneſs is in his Honor ingaged, your Majeſty will be beſt able to judge by viewing the powers themſelves. Further, if the date of theſe powers do expire, beſides the breach of the Capitulations, although the match it ſelf jealouſies and miſtruſts be hazarded, yet the Princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Spring, will be almoſt impoſſible: For by that time new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions and Powers ſhall be after <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> granted by the Prince, which muſt be to the ſatisfaction of both parties, I conceive ſo much of the year will be ſpent, that it will be impoſſible tor the Fleets and other preparations to be in a readineſs againſt the Spring; for it is not to be imagined that they will here proceed effectually with their preparations, untill they ſhall be ſure of the Deſpoſorios, eſpecially when they ſhall have ſeen them ſeverall times deferred on the Prince his part, and that upon pretexts that are not new, or grown ſince the granting of the Powers, but were before in being, and often under debate, and yet were never inſiſted upon to make ſtay of the buſineſs; ſo that it will ſeem that they might better have hindered the granting of them then the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them. Now, if there were not ſtaggering in former reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the which although really there is not, yet can it not but be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; and the clearing of it between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> will coſt much time. I moſt humbly crave your Majeſties pardon if I write unto you with the plainneſs of a true-hearted and faithfull ſervant, who ever hath cooperated honeſtly unto your Majeſties ends. I knew them, I know your Majeſty hath been long time of opinion, that the greateſt aſſurance you could get, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would effectually labour the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire reſtitution of the Palatinate, was that he really proceeded to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the match, and my inſtructions under your Majeſties hands, were to inſiſt upon the reſtoring the Prince Palatine; but not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex it to the treaty of the match, as that therby the match ſhould be hazarded; for that your Majeſty ſeemed confident that here it would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver grow to a perfect concluſion without a ſetled reſolution to give your Majeſty ſatisfaction in the buſineſs of the Palatinate. The ſame courſe I obſerved in the carriage of the buſineſs by his Highneſs and my Lord Duke at their being here, who though they inſiſted on the buſineſs of the Palatinate, yet they held it fit to treat of them diſtinctly, and that the marriage ſhould proceed as a good pawn for the other.</p>
            <p>Since their departure my Lord Ambaſſador Sir <hi>Walter Aſhton</hi> and my ſelf have been preſſed to have this Kings reſolution in writing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Palatinate, and the diſpatches which your Majeſty will receive
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:125863:77"/>herewith concerning that buſineſs, were writ before the receit of your Majeſties Letters; and doubtleſs it is now a great part of their care that that buſineſs may be well entred before the <hi>Infanta's</hi> coming into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> And his Highneſs will well often remember, that the Conde <hi>dé O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livarez</hi> often proteſted a neceſſity of having this buſineſs compounded and ſetled before the marriage, ſaying, otherwiſe they might give a Daughter, and a War within three moneths after, if this ground and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of quarrell ſhould ſtill be left on foot. The ſame language he hath ever held with Sir <hi>Walter Aſhton</hi> and my ſelf, and that it was a firm peace and amity as much as an allyance which they ſought with his Majeſty. So that it is not to be doubted, but that this King concluding the match, reſolveth to imploy his uttermoſt power for your ſatisfaction in the reſtitution of the Prince Palatine.</p>
            <p>The queſtion now will be, whether the buſineſs of the Prince Palatine having relation to many great Princes that are intereſſed therein, living at diſtance, and being (indeed) for the condition and nature of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ſelf, impoſſible to be ended but by a formall treaty, which of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity will require great length, whether the concluſion of the match ſhall any way depend upon the iſſue of this buſineſs, which I conceive to be far from your Majeſties intention; for ſo the Prince might be long kept unbeſtowed by any averſneſs of thoſe which might have particular intereſt in the Princes remaining unmarried, or diſlike with his match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Spain.</hi> But that which I underſtand to be your Majeſties aim, is onely to have the concluſion of this match accompanied with a ſtrong engagement as can be procured from this King for the joyning with your Majeſty not onely in all good Offices for the entire reſtitution of the Palatinate, but otherwiſe if need require of his Majeſties aſſiſtance herein.</p>
            <p>Theſe days paſt I have laboured with all earneſtneſs, and procured this Kings publique anſwer which I am told is reſolved of, and I ſhall within theſe few days have it to ſend to your Majeſty, as alſo a private Propoſition which will be put into your hands; and ſhall not fail fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to purſue your Majeſties preſent directions of procuring this Kings Declaration, in what ſort your Maieſty may rely upon this Kings aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in caſe the Emperour or the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> hinder the entire reſtitution of the Prince Palatine. Bu I conceive (if it be your inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) that I ſhould firſt here procure this Kings peremptory anſwer in the whole buſineſs, and how he will be aſſiſtant unto your Maieſty in caſe of the Emperours or the Duke of <hi>Bavaria's</hi> averſneſs. And that I ſhould ſend it to your Maieſty, and receive again your anſwer before I deliver the Powers for the Depoſorios, the match would thereby if not
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:125863:78"/>be hazarded, yet I conceive the Infanta's going at Spring would be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred altogether impoſſible. For if upon the arrival of the Approbation I cannot refuſe them, but upon ſome grounds; if I alleadge your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties deſire of having the Depoſories deferred untill Chriſtmaſs, they know as well as my ſelf that his Highneſs Proxy is then out of date, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the infringing of the Capitulations; and they will judge it is a great ſcorn put upon this King, who ever ſince the Princes granting of the powers hath called himſelf the Infanta's Deſpoſado, and to that effect the Prince hath writ unto him in ſome of his Letters. Beſides, it will be held here a point of great diſhonour unto the Infanta, if the powers called for by her friends ſhould be detained by the Prince his part: and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover elſe may have deſerved it, ſhe certainly hath not deſerved diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect nor diſcomfort. Further, upon my refuſal to deliver the powers, all preparations which now go on cheerfully and apace will be ſtayed, and there will enter in ſo much diſtruſt, and ſo many troubles and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, that if the main buſineſs run not hazard by them, at leaſt much time will be ſpent to cleer them.</p>
            <p>I muſt therefore in diſcharge of my duty tell your Majeſty, that all your Majeſties buſineſſes here are in a fair way; the Match and all that is capitulated therein, they profeſs punctually to perform.</p>
            <p>In the buſineſs of the Palatinate, I continue my earneſt and faithful endeavours, and they proteſt they infinitely deſire, and will to the utmoſt of their powers endeavour to procure your Majeſties ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>The Prince is like to have a moſt worthy and vertuous Lady, and who much loveth him, and all things elſe depending upon this match are in good and hopefull way.</p>
            <p>This is now the preſent eſtate of your Majeſties affairs, as it appeareth unto me and to Sir <hi>Walter Aſhton,</hi> with whom I have communicated this Diſpatch, as I do all things elſe concerning your Majeſties ſervice. And I muſt cleerly let your Majeſty underſtand, that I conceive by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the powers when this King ſhall call for them, and offering to defer the Depoſories untill Chriſtmaſs, that your Majeſties buſineſs will run a hazard, what by the diſtaſte and diſguſt that will be raiſed here, and what by the art and induſtry of thoſe which are enemies to the match, whereof every Court hath plenty in Chriſtendom.</p>
            <p>That therefore which I preſume with all humility, is, That you would he pleaſed to give me order with all poſſible ſpeed, that when the buſines ſhall come cleered from <hi>Rome,</hi> and that the powers of the marriage ſhall be demanded of me in the behalf of this King, that I may deliver them, and no ways ſeek to interrupt or ſuſpend the Depoſorios, but aſſiſt and help to a perfect concluſion of the match</p>
            <pb n="141" facs="tcp:125863:78"/>
            <p>And for the buſineſs of the Palatinate, I continue my earneſt and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full endeavours to engage this King as far as ſhall be poſſible, both for the doing of all good offices for the Palatines entire reſtitution, herein I will not fail (as likewiſe fo this Kings declaration of aſſiſance in caſe the Emperor or Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> ſhall oppoſe the ſaid reſtitution) to uſe all poſſible means; and I conceive the diſpatch of the Match will be a good pawn in the buſineſs, and the help and aſſiſtance which the Princes being once betrothed would be able to give in this Court to all your Majeſties buſineſſes would be of good conſideration.</p>
            <p>So fearing I have already preſumed too far upon your Majeſies pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, I humbly crave your Majeſties pardon, and recommend you to the holy protection of God, reſting</p>

            <p>I find that upon the news that is now come from the Duke of <hi>Paſtrava,</hi> that the Pope hath cleerly paſſed the Diſpenſation, which is now hourly expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here. There is an intention to call preſently upon me for the Princes powers for the marriage left in my hands, the which I know not upon what ground or reaſon to detain, the Prince having engaged (in the ſaid powers) the faith and word of a Prince no way to revoke and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from them, but that they ſhould remain in full force till Chriſtmaſs, and delivered unto me a politique declaration o his pleaſure, that upon the coming of the Diſpenſation I ſhould deliver them unto this King, that they might be put in execution; and hereof likewiſe was there by Secretary <hi>Serita</hi> as a publique Notary an Inſtrument drawn, atteſted by all the witneſſes preſent. If I ſhall alleadge your Majeſties pleaſure of having the marriage deferred untill one of the Holidays, although they ſhould condeſcend thereunto, that impoſſible, for the powers will be then expired. If I ſhall inſiſt upon the reſtitution of the Palatinate, this King hath therein declared his anſwer; and it would be much wondred why that ſhould be now added fo a condition of the marriage, having ever hitherto been treated of as a buſineſs apart, and was in being at the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:125863:79"/>granting of the ſaid powers, and hath been often under debate, but never ſpecified, nor the powers delivered upon any condition of having any ſuch point firſt cleered; and I muſt confeſs unto your Majeſty I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not how with honour, and that exact dealing which hath ever been obſerved in all your Majeſties actions, the powers can be detained, unleſs there ſhould appear ſome new and emergent cauſe ſince the granting of them, whereof as yet I hear none ſpecified: Therefore being loath to be the inſtrument by whoſe hands any thing ſhould paſs, that might have the leaſt reflection upon your Majeſties or the Princes honour (which I ſhall ever value more then my life or ſafety) and judging it likewiſe to conduce more to your ſervice, and aſſuring my ſelf that your Majeſties late direction to have the marriage upon one of the holidays in Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſs, was for want of due information that the powers will be then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, I have thought it fit (with the advice of Sir <hi>Walter Aſhton</hi>) to raiſe no ſcruple in the delivery of the ſaid powers, but do intend when they ſhall be required to paſs on to the nominating of a prefixed day for the Depoſorio's; but I ſhall endeavour to defer the time, untill I may be advertiſed of your Majeſties pleaſure, if it may be within the ſpace of 24 dayes, and will labour to find ſome handſom and fair occaſion for the deferring of them, without alleadging any directions in that kind from your Majeſty or the Prince.</p>
            <p>The reaſons why I have thought it fit to take this reſolution, are, Firſt I find by your Majeſties letters and the Princes, that your intent is to proceed in the marriage, and to that purpoſe your Majeſty and the Prince have ſet me free to deliver the powers according to the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, by removing that ſcruple of the Infanta's entring into Religion, whereupon they were only ſuſpended.</p>
            <p>Secondly, your Majeſties Letter only intimateth a deſire, not a dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of having the marriage upon one of the holidays of Chriſtmaſs: which I conceive is to be underſtood, if it may well and fittingly be ſo, not if there ſhall be impoſſibility therein by reaſon of the expiring of the powers before, and that the intention of having it then ſhould be overthrown thereby, when I am confident that what your Majeſty writeth is for want of due information of the clauſe of expiration of the powers.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if your Majeſty upon theſe reaſons and ſuch as I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly alleadged unto your Majeſty, ſhould (as I no way doubt but your Majeſty will) give me order for the preſent proceeding to the marriage, yet by my refuſing of the powers, and alleadging your Majeſties or the Princes directions, although afterwards all things ſhould be cleered, yet would it caſt ſome kind of aſperſion and jealouſie upon the ſincerity of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:125863:79"/>your Majeſties and the Princes proceedings. On the contrary ſide, if your Majeſties intention be not to proceed in the match, whereof I ſee no ground, the intimation of that may be as well a moneth hence as now: And I judge it duty in a ſervant, eſpecially in a buſineſs of ſo high a conſequence, and wherein your Majeſty hath ſpent ſo much time, to give his maſter leiſure to repair to his ſecond cogitations before he do any act that may diſorder or overthrow.</p>
            <p>This I offer with all humility unto your Majeſties wiſe and juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and beſeech you to make interpretation of my proceedings herein according to my dutifull and zealous care of your honour and ſervice. I have of purpoſe diſpatcht this Poſt with this Letter, to the end I may receive your Maieſties directions in this particular with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpeed, which I hope ſhall be to proceed directly to the marriage ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Capitulations, and ſo to order all things for the Princeſs he journy in the Spring. And for the Palatinate, your Maieſty may be confident there ſhall be diligence uſed in procuring a ſpeedy and good reſolution. So, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

This being done, we make you offer of a preſent and full reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of all the Palatinate unto the perſon of your ſon, and that you ſhall be his Adminiſtrato during your life. And that after the death of

In contemplation whereof they have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached a degree neerer, to wit, that the Electorall dignity ſhall come again to your perſon after the Duke of <hi>Bavaria's</hi> death. In which Treaty of marriage, to clear the principall difficulty which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted with the education of your ſon with the Emperour, we have taken from them all hope therein (wherein we aſſure our ſelves you will be content) and are purpoſed that he ſhal have his education with our ſon, and with and in the preſence of the <hi>Infanta,</hi> when ſhe ſhall be in our Court.

Firſt, I moſt humbly thank your Majeſty for the paternall care which you continue and ſhew in this occaſion; and which doth more comfort me, and my dear wife in our afflictions, then the fear of humane events can grieve or incline us to be willing to recover the loſs of goods with the loſs of honors. I will therefore uſe the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which your Majeſty is pleaſed to give me in anſwering every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar point of your Letter. In the firſt whereof I obſerve the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my enemies, who require a perſonall ſubmiſſion (intended to precede all other things) under the ſafe conduct of the Emperour; whereas by natural order uſed in theſe occaſions, the reſtitution which is materiall and ſubſtantiall, ought by reaſon to precede the other, being but a point of ceremony, at the leaſt it is neceſſary that all things be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and concluded under ſuch aſſurances as ſhall be held convenient; and then if the intentions on the Emperours part be reall and ſincere, and without any aim to take advantage upon my perſon (as the Emperour <hi>Charls</hi> 5. did upon the Lantgrave of <hi>Heſſen</hi> under the ſubtilty of a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a ſyllable in ſafe conduct <hi>Ewis</hi> for <hi>Einis</hi>) the ſaid ſubmiſſion may as well be made by a Deputy as otherwiſe, whereby I ſhall be freed

For the Electors of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> who have always proteſted againſt the tranſlation of the Electorate; and the other Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> who have like feeling, will diſavow their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations in regard of him who ſhall abandon his own pretentions, and in ſtead of favouring me upon ſome breach of the Treaty, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, may be my oppoſites. Moreover, the experience of things paſt teach us what iſſue we may hereafter expect of the like condition contented to on our part. The Emperour having manifeſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed us in two already, Firſt in the inſtrument which I ſigned for the conditionall reſignation of the Crown of <hi>Bohemia</hi> in the year 1621. Then in my ratification of the ſuſpenſion of Arms this laſt Summer. The firſt having ſerved the Emperour to accelerate his Treaty then on foot with <hi>Bethlem Gabor:</hi> The ſecond to intimidate the Electors of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> that they might not undertake any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Emperour, both the one and the other being divulged to the ſame effect, according to the knowledge which the Emperour had of theſe deſignes before any thing was therin reſolved and concluded: And ſo will the Emperour in all appearance make his profit of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent propoſition, and ſtrike with one ſtone two blows, by hindering the progreſs of <hi>Gabor</hi> on the one ſide, and by continuing on the other the intimidation of the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> who may with reaſon excuſe themſelves if they move not for him, who hath bound himſelf hand and foot, and conſented to a ſubmiſſion, which being yeilded to, it will be always in the Emperours power to break or go on, as he ſhall hold it expedient for himſelf. I do alſo promiſe my ſelf that your Majeſty will have regard that by ſuch ſubmiſſion and intreaty, my undue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription and baniſhment (which being done in prejudice of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the Empire, are therefore held by the Electors of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> of no validity) be not approved, and thereby a mark of infamy ſet upon me and my poſterity. Touching the ſecond point, your Majeſty may be pleaſed to remember, that on the part of <hi>Spain</hi> hope hath alwayes been given me from the beginning, of a totall and intire reſtitution to my own perſon; yea the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> hath aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me by his Letters from <hi>Madrid</hi> in <hi>November</hi> 1622. when the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was not ſo much advanced at this time.

            <p>It ſeems therefore neceſſary above all things to have ſufficient aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for the total reſtitution of my Electorate and Palatinates, before any new treaty of marriage be propoſed: Of the which treaties, as they are ordinarily handled and managed by the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and drawn to length and delays, with the onely aim to the augmentation of their greatneſs, without reſpect to civil honeſty, word or promiſe, I have a dolefull experience in my own houſe in the perſon of one of my prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors <hi>Frederick</hi> the ſecond, who contributed more to the firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation which was laid for the greatneſs of the ſaid houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> then any other German Prince, and for recompence was allured and drawn by the ſpace of many years with treaties and promiſes of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, without any real intention (as was ſeen by the effect) ever to bring them to execution. Seeing therefore that he who had ſo well deſerved of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> (which in all external appearance held him in greater eſtimation then any other German Prince) was never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſo unworthily uſed by them in a treaty of marriage I who have been unduly put into the Ban of the Empire, and ſpoiled of all my honours and goods, by the eagerneſs, hatred and uſurpation of the Emperor himſelf (whoſe daughter is propounded for the marriage in queſtion) know not what to hope but the ſame effect of fraud and deceit which my forenamed predeceſſor found, with a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful repentance of the evil when it was pad remedy. And the Emperor wanteth but two or three years of leiſure, which he ſhall eaſily gain by a treaty of a marriage, to eſtabliſh in <hi>Germany</hi> the tranſlation of my Electoral dignity and Patrimonial eſtate, without any hope ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to recover the like opportunity as at this time, that my pretenſions are not prejudiced by a long interpoſition of time, and that the memory, of undue proceeding in the publication of the Ban againſt my perſon, and the ſaid tranſlation of my Electoral dignity, and ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſure of my patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial inheritance are yet freſh in the affections and minds of the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> who are by the conſideration of their own intereſts moved
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:125863:82"/>with the greater companion to ſee the wounds of my miſeries yet freſh and bleeding, and with paſſion and earneſt deſire to ſee them remedied. And in this place I will ſay ſomething in anſwer to the laſt point of your Majeſties Letter, wherein you commanded me to conſider the means probable and feaſible whereby my condition may be reduced to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtate, and to weigh your Majeſties forces with thoſe of your Allies, and others whereof your Majeſty may hope and be aſſured.</p>
            <p>If your Majeſty hopeth for my reſtitution in <hi>Germany</hi> as an effect of the marriage with <hi>Spain,</hi> nothing elſe is to be done but attend the event with patience: And if you continue to diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> there is no more to be ſaid on this ſubject, but as they have with joint conſent conſpired my ruine with the ſame forces, the ſame councels, and the ſame deſigns, your Majeſty will find (if you pleaſe to unmask the fair, ſeeming, and hidden malice of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> the ſame effect, as in the end you found the open and declared violence and hoſtility of the Imperialiſts, who beſieged your Majeſties garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in my Towns taken into your protection. I will uſe the liberty you have given me to diſcourſe of your Majeſties forces and thoſe of your Allies, and what may further with good probability be hoped from other friends and well-willers.</p>
            <p>In the laſt rank I place what may be hoped from the Princes, of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> who, to wit the two Electors of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> and in effect all the reſt except thoſe of the Catholique league, have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declared the diſavowing of the Emperors proceeding againſt me, and their opinions that the peace of <hi>Germany</hi> dependeth upon my reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; beſides the Levies which they made in the beginning of the laſt ſummer, though by the unlucky accident of the Duke <hi>Chriſtian</hi> of <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> they were ſoon after diſmiſſed. And certainly no want of any other thing to be converted to my aid, but the countenance of a great Prince to ſupport them againſt the power of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the ſame affections remaining ſtill in them, and the ſame reſolution to imbrace the firſt good occaſion that ſhall be preſented for the liberty of <hi>Germany.</hi> Will there want hands for the accompliſhing of ſuch a work, when it ſhall be undertaken openly and earneſtly? ſeeing that the number of thoſe that have their intereſt conjoyned with mine, is great and mighty: For the greater part of the people both horſe and foot which marched under the Catholique banner, were of a contrary Religion to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, and of affection (as it is notorious to all the world) more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the ruine of thoſe Leagues then to their preſervation. But the conduct of ſome powerfull Prince is neceſſary as well to the men of war, us we have ſeen by experience the laſt year. The King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> is
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:125863:82"/>he upon whom all have ſet their eyes: but he being a Prince full of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, and unwilling to enter into play alone, anſwereth unto all inſtances which are made unto him to that end, That as the other Princes have their eyes upon him, ſo hath he his upon your Majeſty.</p>
            <p>It is not for me to judge; but ſince you have commanded me, I will weigh them by the ballance of common judgment. That the felicity wherewith God hath bleſſed the perſon of your Majeſty, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned the three Crowns of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> upon one head; the power of the one of the three alone having done great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the affairs of <hi>Europe</hi> on this ſide the ſea, yea when it was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terballanced by the other, gives demonſtration what your Majeſty may do with the joynt forces of the three together, when you ſhall be pleaſed to take a reſolution therein, chiefly the queſtion being for the intereſt of your own Children; and by the voluntary contribution which we have already had in our ſupport from your Majeſty, we may eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what may be promiſed of them when the publike authority of your Majeſty ſhall be conjoyned with their particular affections; there being no Prince in the world more loved and reverenced of his ſubjects, nor more ſoveraign over their affections and means for the ſervice of your perſon and Royal houſe. Touching the Allies, it is to my great grief that the unhappineſs of this time hath ſeparated a great part of them, the united Provinces of <hi>Germany,</hi> who make profeſſion of the ſame Religion whereof they acknowledge your Majeſty for Defendor and Protector. But the ſame affection remaineth ſtill in them entire and firm, though they have been conſtrained to yield to the preſent neceſſity of their affairs; and the occaſion preſenting it ſelf, your Majeſty may accompt of them.</p>
            <p>The reſt, the Eſtates of the united Provinces to whom we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in our afflictions, who ſupport themſelves by the help of God, and the ſituation of their Country and Forces of their people alone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this time againſt the puiſſance of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſeconded by the Imperialiſts. And in ſtead of fainting under ſuch a burthen, or of giving ear unto the overtures and ſubmiſſions which from day to day are preſented unto them, they now put themſelves to the offenſive, by a good Fleet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and ready to ſet ſail to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> to the end they may at leaſt interrupt the peaceable and annual return of the gold and ſilver of thoſe parts, by which the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> doth continually advance their greatneſs. This is commended by all good men and lovers of the publike liberty as the ſole and only means to caſt to the ground the fearfull power of <hi>Spain,</hi> even as a great tree of large extent cut up by the root; but is held too great for ſuch a little extent of Country as this is,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:125863:83"/>and yet practically, and to be done by forces anſwerable to the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſuch an enterprize: And if your Majeſty would be pleaſed to uſe the Forces of this eſtate by ſea and land, to the oppoſition of their enemies, and by conſequence of mine, their profeſſion of a loyall and ſincere affection with the hazard of their lives and goods for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of your Majeſty, grounded upon the experience of things paſt, their preſent intereſt, and the judgement which may be made of the future, makes me aſſured that your Majeſty may abſolutely diſpoſe of them; and by their means being firmly conjoyned with your Majeſty, give the Law to <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is in obedience to your Majeſties commandment that I have enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged my ſelf ſo far into this diſcourſe, which I will ſend with my moſt humble thanks for the continuance of your moſt gracious and paternall bounty, particularly ſhewed in the care you have of the education of my eldeſt ſon in your Court, who with all the reſt are at your Majeſties diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, and we hope to live notwithſtanding our hard and dolefull condition, to yeild unto your Majeſty the fruits of a devout and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liall gratitude, and I will remain untill the laſt day of my life,</p>

            <head>A Memoriall to the King of Spain, by Sir <hi>Walter Aſhton,</hi> Ambaſſader in Spain. Aug. <hi>29, 1624.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SIr <hi>Walter Aſhton,</hi> Ambaſſador to the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> ſaith, That the King his Maſter hath commanded him to repreſent to your Majeſty, that having declared to your Majeſty the reaſons why he could receive no ſatisfaction by your Majeſties anſwer of the firſt of <hi>January,</hi> and that thereby according to the unanimous conſent of his Parliament he came to diſſolve both the Treaties of the Match and Palatinate, he received another anſwer from your Majeſty, wherein he finds leſs ground to build upon; and having underſtood that either by the <hi>Padre de Maeſtro,</hi> or your Majeſties Ambaſſadors which have aſſiſted theſe dayes paſt in this Court, there was ſomething to be propounded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared touching the buſineſs of the Palatinate, whereby he might have received ſatisfaction, the ſaid Ambaſſadors untill now have not ſaid anything at all to purpoſe which comparing with other circumſtances of their ill carriage, he gathers and doubts, that according to the ill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and depraved intentions wherewith they have proceeded in all things, but eſpecially in particular they have laboured to hinder the good correſpondency and ſo neceſſary and deſired intelligence which ſhould be conſerved with your Majeſty. Furthermore he ſaith, That the King his Maſter hath commanded him to give account to your Majeſty, that in an Audience which he gave to the Marqueſs <hi>de Injioſa</hi> and <hi>Don Carlo Colomma,</hi> they under Cloak and pretext of zeal &amp; particular care of his perſon, pretended to diſcover unto him a very great conjuration againſt his perſon and Royall Dignity, and it was,</p>
            <p>That at the beginning of the Parliament, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> had conſulted with certain Lords, of the arguments and means which were to be taken touching the breaking and diſſolving of the Treaties of the Palatinate and Match; and the conſultations paſſed thus far, That if his Majeſty would not accommodate himſelf to their councels, they would give him a houſe of pleaſure whither he might retire himſelf to his ſports, in regard that the Prince had now years ſufficient to, and parts anſwerable for the government of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Information was of that quality, that it was ſufficient to put im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in him of perpetual jealouſies, in regard that through the ribs of the Duke he gave wounds to the Prince his ſon, and the Nobility;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:125863:84"/>and it is not probable that they could bring to effect ſuch deſigns with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out departing totally from the obligation of faith and loyalty which they owed to his Perſon and Crown, becauſe the Lords made themſelves culpable as concealers: And it is not likely that the Duke would hurl himſelf into ſuch an enter prize, without communicating it firſt with the Prince, and knowing his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>And becauſe this information might be made more clear, he did make many inſtances unto the ſaid Ambaſſadors, that they would give him the Authors of the ſaid Conjuration, this being the ſole means whereby their own honor might be preſerved, &amp;c. whereby their great zeal and care they had pretended to have of his perſon, might appear. But inſtead of confirming the great zeal they had pretended to bear him; all the anſwer they made him, conſiſted of Arguments againſt the diſcovery of the Conſpirators: So that for the confirmation of the ſaid report, there remained no other means then the examination of ſome of his Councell of State, and principall ſubjects, which he put in execution, and made them take oath every one particularly in his own preſence, and commanded that ſuch interrogatories and queſtions ſhould be propounded unto them that were moſt pertinent to the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; ſo that neither part, particle, or circumſtance remained, which was not exactly examined and winnowed, and he found in the Duke and the reſt that were accuſed, a ſincere Innocency touching the accuſations and imputation wherewith they were charged.</p>
            <p>This being ſo, he turned to make new inſtances unto the ſaid Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, that they ſhould not prefer the diſcovery of the names of the Conſpirators to the ſecurity of his Royall perſon, and truth and honor of thmeſelves, and the hazard of an opinion to be held, and judged the Traytors of a plot of ſuch malice, ſed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tion and danger. But the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors remaining in a knotty kind of obſtinacy, reſolved to conceal the Authors. Nevertheleſs afterterwards he gave them an audience, wherein the Marqueſs of <hi>Injioſa</hi> took his leave.</p>
            <p>Few days after they demanded new audience, pretending that they had ſomthing to ſay that concerned the publique good, and conduced to the entire reſtitution of the Palatinate, with deſire to loſe no opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that might conduce thereunto, and therewith the confirmation and conſervation of the friendſhip with your Majeſty having ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended ſome few days to give them audience, thinking that being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by better adviſed, they would reſolve upon a wiſer courſe, and declare the Authors of ſo pernitious an action, and having ſince made many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and attended the ſucceſs of ſo long patience, he ſent his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:125863:85"/>and Sir <hi>Francis Cottington</hi> Secretary to the Prince, commanding them that they ſhould ſignifie unto the Ambaſſadors, that he deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then the continuance of the friendſhip 'twixt both the Crowns; and if ſo they had any thing to ſay, they would communicate it to the ſaid Secretaries, as perſons of ſo great truſt, which he ſent to that end: And if they made difficulty of this, that they would chuſe amongſt his Councell of State, thoſe which they liked beſt, and he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that they ſhould preſently repair unto them; and if this did not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſeem beſt unto them, that they would ſend what they had to ſay in a Letter ſealed up, by whom ſhould ſeem beſt unto them, and he would receive it with his own hands. But the Ambaſſadors misbehaving themſelves in all that was propounded, the ſaid Secretaries according to the order which they brought, told them, that they being the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of an information ſo dangerous and ſeditious, had made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves uncapable to treat further with the King their Matter; and were it not for the reſpect to the King his dear and beloved brother and their Maſter, and in contemplation of their condition as Ambaſſadors of ſuch a Majeſty, he would and could by the Law of Nations, and the right of his own Royall Juſtice, proceed againſt them with ſuch ſeverity us their offence deſerved, but for the reaſons aforeſaid he would leave the reparation hereof to the juſtice of their King, of whom he would demand and require it.</p>
            <p>In conformity whereof the ſaid Ambaſſador of the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> ſaith, that the King his Maſter hath commanded him to demand reparation &amp; ſatisfaction of your Majeſty againſt the ſaid Marquis <hi>de Injioſa</hi> and Don <hi>Carlos Colomma,</hi> making your Majeſty Judge of the great ſcandall and enormous offence which they have committed againſt them and the publick right, and expect juſtice from your Majeſty in the demonſtrations and chaſtiſements which your Majeſty ſhall inflict upon them. which for his proceeding ſake with your Majeſty, and out of your Majeſties own uprightneſs and goodneſs ought to be expected.</p>
            <p>Furthermore he ſaith, that the King his Maſter hath commanded him to aſſure your Majeſty, that till now he hath not mingled the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and friendſhip he held with your Majeſty, with the faults and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences of your Miniſters, but leaves and reſtrains them to their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and that he remains with your Majeſty in the true and ancient friendſhip and brotherhood, as heretofore; and that he is ready to give hearing to anything that ſhall be reaſon, and to anſwer thereunto: and when your Majeſty is pleaſed to ſend your Ambaſſadors thither, he will make them all good treaty, and receive them with that good love that is due.</p>
            <pb n="155" facs="tcp:125863:85"/>
            <p>For conclusion, the ſaid Ambaſſador humbly beſeecheth your Majeſty will be pleaſed to obſerve and weigh the care and tenderneſs wherewith the King his Maſter proceeded with your Majeſties Ambaſſadors, not obliging to precipitate reſolutions, but giving them much time to prove and give light of that which they had ſpoken; and beſides opening unto them many ways that they might comply with their orders, if they had any ſuch. Which courſe if they had taken, they might well have given ſatisfaction to the King his Maſter, and moderated the ſo grounded opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their ill proceedings againſt the peace, and ſo good intelligence and correſpondence betwixt both the Crowns.</p>

            <p> IF the Thrones of Heaven and Earth were to be ſollicited one and the ſame way, I ſhould have learned by my often praying to God for your Majeſty, how to pray to your Majeſty to other. But the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies of the Church and Court are different as in many other points, to eſpecially in this, That in the one there is not ſo poor a friend but may offer his vows immediately to the Almighty; whereas in the other a right loyal ſubject may pour out his ſoul in vain, without an <hi>Ora pro nobis.</hi> Now ſuch is the obſcure condition of your humble Suppliant, as I know no Saint about your ſacred Majeſty to whom I can addreſs my oriſons, or in whoſe mediation I dare repoſe the leaſt aſſurance. Let it be therefore lawful for me in this extraordinary occaſion to paſs the ordinary forms; and raiſing my ſpirits above uncertainties, to fix my intire faith upon your Majeſties ſupreme goodneſs, which is an ever ought to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both the beſt Tribunal, and the beſt Sanctuary for a good cauſe. But how good ſoever my cauſe be, it would be high preſumption in me to ſtand upon it. I have therefore choſen rather to caſt my ſelf at your Majeſties feet, from whence I would not willingly riſe, but remain a monument of ſorrow and humility till I have obtained ſome gracious anſwer to my Petition: For though your Majeſties thoughts cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern ſo low, as to conceive how much it importeth a poor diſtreſſed
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:125863:86"/>Suppliant to be reviled, neglected, yet you may be pleaſed to believe that we are as highly affected, and as much anguiſhed with the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities that preſs our little fortunes, as Princes are with theirs.

The ſuit I am to make to your Majeſty is no ſleight one, it may be eaſily granted without references: For I dare aſſure your Majeſty upon my life, it is neither againſt the Laws of the Kingdom, nor will diminiſh any of your treaſure, either that of your coffers, or that of your peoples hearts; it being an act of clemencie, or rather a word, for even that will ſatisfie to create in your poor dejected Suppliant a new heart, and ſend him away as full of content as he is now of grief and deſpair. Nor is it for my ſelf I thus implore your Majeſties grace, but for one that is far more worthy, and in whom all that I am conſiſts, my dear Brother, who I know not by what misfortune hath fallen, or rather been puſhed into your Majeſties diſpleaſure; not in dark and crooked ways, as corrupt and ill-affected ſubjects uſe to walk, and near to break their necks in, but even in the great road, which both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf &amp; all good <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> that know not the paths of the Court, would have ſworn would have led moſt ſafely and moſt directly to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties ſervice from your Majeſties diſpleaſure; there needs no other inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to crucifie a generous and honeſt-minded ſuppliant, upon whom hath iſſued and been derived a whole torrent of exemplary puniſhment, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

But (thanks be to God) his conſcience never ſtarted; and for his obedience herein ſhewed, it was not in the power of any authority to ſurprize it: For at the inſtant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out asking one minutes time of reſolution, he rendered himſelf to the officers diſcretion, who (according to his directions) brought him up captive, and preſented him at the Councell Table as a Delinquent, from whence he was as ſoon committed to Tower, where he ever ſince hath been kept cloſe priſoner, and that with ſo ſtrict a hand, as his own beloved wife and my ſelf having ſometime ſince urgent and unffaigned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:125863:86"/>moſt honorable Privy Councell for the favour of acceſſe, we were to our great diſcomforts denied it, by reaſon as their Lordſhips were pleaſed to declare unto us, that he had not ſatisfied, your Majeſty fully in ſome points, which being ſo far from being his fault, as I dare ſay it is the greateſt part of his affliction, that he ſees himſelf debarred from means of doing it. The Lords Commiſſioners that were appointed by your Majeſty to examine his offence, ſince the firſt week of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, have not done him the honor to be with him; by which means not onely his body, but (the moſt part of his mind) his humble intentions to your Majeſty are kept in reſtraint. May it pleaſe therefore your moſt excellent Majeſty now at length after five moneths impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and extream durance, to ordain ſuch expedition in this cauſe, as may ſtand with your juſtice, and yet not avert your mercy, either of them will ſerve our turns; but that which is moſt agreeable to your Royall and gracious inclination, will beſt accompliſh our deſire. To live ſtill in cloſe priſon is all one to be buried alive; and for a man that hath any hope of ſalvation, it were better to pray for the day of judgment, then to lie languiſhing in ſuch waking miſery; yet not ours but your Majeſties wil be done. For if in your princely wiſdom you ſhall not think it a fit ſeaſon to reſtore him to his former condition, or to accept the fruit of his corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, an humble and penitent ſubmiſſion for his unhappineſs in offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Majeſty, which I aſſure my ſelf is long ſince ripe and grown to full perfection in ſo forward affection, and ſo proper for all duties as his hath ever been: If (I ſay) it be not yet time to have mercy, but that he muſt ſtill remain within the walls of bondage to expiate that which he did in theſe priviledged ones, my hope is, that he will die at any time for your Majeſties ſervice, and will find patience to live any where for your Majeſties pleaſure; only thus much let me beſeech your Majeſties grace again and again, not to deny your humble and moſt obedient ſuppliant, that you will at leaſt be pleaſed to mitigate the rigor of his ſufferings ſo far as to grant him the liberty of the Tower, that he may no longer groan under the burthen of thoſe incomodities which daily prejudice his health &amp; fortune, in a higher degree (I believe) then either your Majeſty knows or intends; I am the more bold to importune your Majeſty in the point of favour, becauſe it concerns my own good &amp; preſervation: For your Maj. ſhall deign underſtand that I your ſuppliant have no means to live but what proceeds from his brotherly love and bounty; ſo as if I may not be ſuffered to go to him and receive order for my maintenance, I know none but <hi>Our Father, which art in heaven</hi> to beg my daily bread on; he that was my father on earth is long ſince departed (if I have not been misinformed) who was then beyond ſea, your Majeſties anger was to him little better then the meſſenger of death, though I perſwade my ſelf it was rather ſent in your Majeſties Name then in your Warrant.</p>

            <p>For what uſe could your Majeſty have of his not being, who neither was, nor could be ever but your faithful and affectionate ſervant, who in his ſoul adored your Royal Majeſty as much as ever mortal man did any mortal God; laſtly, whoſe heart was ſo bent to pleaſe your Majeſty, as the very ſound of your diſpleaſure was enough to break it. And more perfect obedience then this can no ſubject ſhew, to make his Soveraigns favour equal to life and death.</p>
            <p>Pardon me, dread Soveraign, if in this occaſion I cannot hinder my Fathers ghoſt from appearing: For how can it poſſibly be at reſt, as long as your fatal diſpleaſure reigns ſtill in his family, and makes it the houſe of continual mourning? Remove then (if it be your bleſſed will) the clouds that have been ſo long hanging over our heads; and let not the preſent ſtorm that wants matter to produce, extort a thunderbolt: For what is <hi>Philips,</hi> or the ſon of <hi>Philips,</hi> that your Majeſty ſhould ſo deſtroy them ? We are unworthy of <hi>Caeſar's</hi> anger, as well in regard of our means as of our innocencie ?</p>
            <p>To conclude my prayers, I moſt humbly beſeech your Majeſty to forgive them; and let not the ignorance of the ſtile, or ceremonies uſed in the Court, be imputed to your humble and well-meaning Suppliant, as a willing want of reverence; in whoſe breaſt theſe two legal qualities, Love and Fear, do more vigorouſly meet, or who could more willingly part with his eſſence, to add the leaſt acquiſition to the greatneſs and majeſty of his Soveraign. True it is, that the ſubject that imployed the faculties of my ſoul at this preſent, is of ſuch a nature, as I could not deny it the uttermoſt of my affection; and he that thinks he can never ſpeak enough, may eaſily ſpeak too much. That neither my ſelf nor my brother have failed in any thing but words, that your Majeſty will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, without that all crimes are equal, and as much danger lies in an humble Petition as in a plot of high Treaſon.</p>
            <p>Be pleaſed then (moſt gracious Soveraign) to give us back one gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious word, and keep our undoubted hearts, at leaſt ſhew us ſo much mercy as to judge us according to your own goodneſs: For if we had not liberty to appeal thither, we ſhould be in danger of loſing the beſt part of our birthright, and inſtead of your Majeſties ſubjects become other mens ſlaves. From your Majeſty therefore, and from no other, your faithful ſuppliant craves and expect the joyfull word of grace: which if I may be ſo happy as to carry my poor brother before he grows any elder in miſery, I ſhall fill an honeſt heart with prayers and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving: And for my particular, your Majeſties greateſt favour and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality ſhall not more oblige or better affect others, then your Royal clemencie ſhall me. In memory whereof I ſhall daily pray, that your

               <hi>Oliver St. Johns</hi> to the Major of <hi>Marlborough</hi> againſt the Benevolence.</head>
            <p>AS I think, this kind of Benevolence is againſt Law, Reaſon, and Religion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Law is in the Statute called <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> 9. <hi>H.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 29. That no Free-man be any way deſtroyed but by the Lawes of this Land.</p>
            <p>Secondly, beſides that the ſaid Statute of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is by all Princes ſince eſtabliſhed and confirmed, it is in the ſpeciall caſe of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary or free grants enacted and decreed 25. <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. That no ſuch be drawn into cuſtome, and <hi>cap.</hi> 6. That henceforth be taken no ſuch Aids, Tasks, free Grants, or Prizes, but by aſſent of all the Realm, and for the good of the ſame. And in <hi>primo R.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. That the Subjects and Commons in this Realm from henceforth ſhall in no wiſe be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by any charge or impoſition called a Benevolence, or any ſuch like charge, and that ſuch exactions called a Benevolence, ſhall be damned and annulled for ever.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is not onely without, but againſt reaſon, that the Commous in their ſeverall and particulars, ſhould be made relievers or ſuppliers of his Majeſties wants, who neither know his wants, nor the ſums that may be this way raiſed to ſupply the ſame.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is againſt reaſon that the particular and ſeverall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons diſtracted, ſhould oppoſe their judgment and diſcretion to the judgement and diſcretion of the wiſdom of their Land aſſembled in Parliament, who have there denied any ſuch aid.</p>
            <pb n="160" facs="tcp:125863:89"/>
            <p>It argueth in us want of love and due reſpect of our Soveraign Lord and King, which ought to be in every of us towards each other, which is to ſtay every one which we ſee falling, and reduce the current. What proſperity can there be expected to befall either our King or Nation, when the King ſhall haply of ignorance, or ('tis I hope) out of forgetfulneſſe or headineſſe, commit ſo great a ſin againſt his God, as is the violating of his great and ſolemn oath taken at his coronation for the maintaining of his Lawes, Liberties and Cuſtomes of this Noble Realm, &amp; his Subjects, ſome for fear, ſome in pride, ſome to pleaſe others, ſhall joyn hands to forward ſo unhappy an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> achievement, can he any way more highly offend the Divine Majeſty (whom he then invocated) as alſo can he then give unto another. <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. If ſuch an one ſhould riſe up (which God forbid) a greater advantage, let theſe Articles put up againſt <hi>R.</hi> 2. be looked on, it will appear that the breach of the Laws, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringing the Liberties, &amp; failing in this his oath, were the main blemiſhes wherewith he could diſtain and ſpot the honor of that good and gentle Prince, who indeed was rather by others abuſed, then of himſelfe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievouſly any way diſpoſed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as very irreligiouſly and uncharitably we help forward the Kings Majeſty in that grievous ſin of perjury; ſo into what an helliſh danger we plunge our ſelves even ſo many of us as contribute, is to be learned out of the ſeverall curſes and ſentences of excommunination gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out againſt all ſuch givers, and namely the two following, <hi>viz.</hi> the great curſe given out the 36. <hi>H.</hi> 3. againſt all breakers of the Liberties and cuſtomes of the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> with their Abettors, Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and Executioners, wherein by the ſentence of <hi>Boniface,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the chief part of all the Biſhops of this Land, are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> excommunicated. And that of 24. <hi>Ed.</hi> I. denounced imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly upon the Acts made againſt ſuch Benevolence, free Grants and Impoſitions had and taken without common aſſent; which becauſe it is not ſo large as that former, I will ſet down as our Books deliver the ſame.</p>
            <pb n="181" facs="tcp:125863:89"/>
            <p>IN the Name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, <hi>Amen.</hi> Whereas our Soveraign Lord the King, to the honour of God, and of the Holy Church, and for the common profit of the Realm, hath granted for him and his heirs forever theſe Articles above written: <hi>Robert</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Primate of all <hi>England,</hi> admoniſhed all his Province once, twice, and thrice, becauſe that ſhortneſs will not ſuffer ſo much delay, as to give knowledge to all the people of <hi>England</hi> of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents in writing.

            <head>The Juſtices of Peace in the County of <hi>Devon</hi> to the Lords of the Councell.</head>
            <p>THe Letters from his ſacred Majeſty unto the Juſtices of Peace in this County, together with your Lordſhips, have been opened and read according to the directions in your Lordſhips Letter to our high Sheriff expreſſed, and the weighty buſineſs therein contained, hath been maturely and ſpeedily debated, according to our moſt bounden duties to his excellent Majeſty, and the many concurring neceſſities which preſs the expedition of ſuch a ſervice: and in thoſe reſpects we can do no leſs then give your Lordſhips a timely knowledge of the vote and opinion of us all, which was this day almoſt in the ſame words delivered by every of us.</p>
            <p>That the ſum enjoyned to be levied by the firſt of March, is not to be ſo ſuddenly raiſed out of this County by any means, much leſs by way of perſwaſion; and hereof we had lately a certain experience in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the loans, which notwithſtanding the fear apprehended by the preſence of the Purſivant, hath come at leaſt 6000. l. ſhort of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſum, and without him we ſuppoſe would have been much leſs, and we are confident that nothing but extremities, which had need alſo be back't by Law, will raiſe his Majeſty a ſufficient quantity of treaſure for his occaſions. For our ſelves, at the time of the propoſition of the forementioned Loans, we did according to his Majeſties proclamation and inſtruction then ſent us, engage our faithfull promiſe to our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen, that if they willingly yeilded to his Majeſties neceſſities at this time, we would never more be Inſtruments in the levy of aids of that kind, his Majeſties intentions ſo clearly manifeſted not to make that a preſident, was the cauſe of that engagement, and we conceive it cannot be for his honor or ſervice for us to be the means of ſuch a breach. That his Majeſties affairs and of his Allies, do all want an inſtant ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of Royall proviſions; his provident and Princely Letter hath fully taught us; but we have much more cauſe to wiſh then hope that theſe parts ſo lately and ſo many ways impoveriſhed, can yeild it.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhips may vouchſafe to remember how much this County hath been charged ſince the beginning of the war, though ſometimes refreſhed with payment, which we acknowledge with humble thanks. By our own late loan of 3 5000. l. and 6000. l. more ſent by Sir <hi>Thomas Wiſe</hi>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:125863:90"/>and Mr. <hi>Stroad,</hi> and yet there remains due to it for the Coat and Conduct of their own impreſt Soldiers, for divers voyages for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits intended for the Iſle of <hi>Ree</hi> for the conduct of the whole Army hence, beſides three Companies ſtand yet here for <hi>Silly,</hi> and no ſmall number of ſcattered ſick, whoſe mortall infection hath more diſcouraged the people then the charge.</p>
            <p>That many and almoſt unaccountable are our ways of expence, few or none have we of in-come for the want of Trade, how then can there be any quantity of money to disburſe; their bodies and goods are left which (we are aſſured) will be ever ready for this Majeſties defence, and to be imployed in his Majeſties ſervice as far forth as ever our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers have yeilded them to his Majeſties Royall Progenitors.</p>
            <p>Particular proofs we would have made of the peoples diſability to have ſatisfied his Majeſties demands, but we had rather adventure our ſelves, and this humble advertiſement upon your Lordſhips private and favourable inſtructions, then to expoſe his Majeſties honor to publique deniall, and misſpend his pretious time, which applied to more certain courſes may attain his Princely and religious ends, wherein to be his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Inſtruments will be our earthly happineſs, and ſingular comfort to be your Lordſhips obedient ſervants.</p>

            <head>The Biſhop of Lincoln L. Keeper, to the Biſhop of London, concerning Preaching and Catechiſing.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My very good Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p> I Doubt not before this time you have received from me the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his moſt excellent Majeſty concerning Preaching and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which are ſo graciouſly ſet down, that no godly or diſcreet man can otherwiſe then acknowledge that they do much tend to edification, if he take them not up upon report, but do punctually conſider the tenor of the words as they lie, and doth not give an ill conſtruction to that which may receive a fair interpretation. Notwithſtanding becauſe ſome few Church-men and many of the people have ſiniſterly conceived, as we here find, that thoſe Inſtructions do tend to the reſtraint of the exerciſe of Preaching, and do in ſome ſort abate the number of Sermons, and ſo conſequently by degrees do make a breach to ignorance and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, his Majeſty in his Princely wiſdom hath thought fit that I ſhould advertiſe your Lordſhip of the grave and weighty reaſons which induced his Highneſs to preſcribe that which was done.</p>
            <p>You are therefore to know, that his Majeſty being much troubled and grieved at the heart to hear every day of ſo many defections from our Religion both to Popery and Anabaptiſm, or other points of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration in ſome parts of this Kingdom; and conſidering with much admiration what might be the cauſe thereof, eſpecially in the reign of ſuch a King who doth ſo conſtantly profeſs himſelf an open adverſary to the ſuperſtition of the one, and madneſs of the other, his Princely wiſdom could fall upon no one greater probability then the lightneſs, affectedneſs, and unprofitableneſs of that kind of Preaching which hath been of late years too much taken up in Court, Univerſity, City and Country.</p>
            <p>The uſuall ſcope of very many Preachers is noted to be ſoaring up in points of Divinity too deep for the capacity of the people, or muſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up of ſo much reading, or a diſplaying of their own wit, or an ignorant medling with Civill matters, as well in the private ſeverall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes and Corporations, as in the publique of the Kingdom, or a venting of their own diſtaſtes, or a ſmoothing up thoſe idle fancies (which when the Text ſhall occaſion the ſame, is not onely approved but much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:125863:94"/>by his Royall Majeſty) both againſt the perſons of Papiſts and Puritans.</p>
            <p>Now the people bred up with this kind of teaching, and never inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the Catechiſm, and fundamentall grounds of Religion, are for all this airy nouriſhment, no better then a braſs Tabret, new Table-books to be filled up either with Manuals and Catechiſmes of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prieſts, or the papers and pamphlets of Anabaptiſts, Browniſts and Puritans.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty therefore calling to mind the ſaying of <hi>Tertullian, Id verum quod primum;</hi> and remembring with what doctrine the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her firſt and moſt happy Reformation did drive out the one, and keep out the other from poyſoning and infecting the people of this Kingdom, doth find that the whole ſcope of this doctrine is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Articles of Religion, the two books of Homilies, the leſſer and the greater Catechiſm, which his Majeſty doth therefore recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend again in theſe Directions as the theams and proper ſubjects of all ſound and edifying preaching.</p>
            <p>And ſo far are theſe Directions from abridging, that his Majeſty doth expect at our hands that it ſhould increaſe the number of Sermons, by renewing every Sunday in the afternoon in all Pariſh-Churches throughout the Kingdom that primitive and moſt profitable expoſition of the Catechiſm, wherewith the people, yea very children may be timely ſeaſoned and inſtructed in all the heads of Chriſtian Religion. The which kind of expoſition (to our amendment be it ſpoken) is more diligently obſerved in all the Reformed Churches of <hi>Europe,</hi> then of late it hath been here in <hi>England.</hi> I find his Majeſty much moved with this neglect, and reſolved (if we that are Biſhops do not ſee a reformation thereof, which I truſt we ſhall) to recommend to the care of the Civil Magiſtrate: ſo far is his Highneſs from giving the leaſt diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſolid preaching, or diſcreet and religious Preachers.</p>
            <p>To all theſe I am to add, That it is his Majeſties Princely pleaſure that both the former Directions and thoſe reaſons of the ſame be fairly written in every Regiſters Office, to the end that every Preacher of what denomination ſoever may, if he be ſo pleaſed, take out Copies of either of them with his own hand <hi>gratis,</hi> paſſing nothing in the name of fee or expedition: But if he do uſe the pains of the Regiſter or the Clerk, then to pay ſome moderate Fee to be pronounced in open Court by the Chancellor and Commiſſaries of the place, taking the direction and approbation of my Lords the Biſhops.</p>
            <pb n="192" facs="tcp:125863:95"/>
            <p>Laſtly, That from henceforward a courſe may be taken that every Parſon, Vicar, Curate, or Lecturer do make and exhibit an account for the performance of theſe his Majeſties directions, and the reaſons for the ſame, at the enſuing Viſitation of the Biſhops and Archdeacons, paying to the Regiſter 6d. for the exhibiting. And ſo wiſhing, but withall in his Majeſties name requiring your Lordſhip to have a ſpecial and extraordinary care of the premiſſes, I leave you to the Almighty.</p>

The incroachment which is made upon your Authority, takes footing only by the danger that is in telling it you freely; conſider (if it pleaſe you) that thoſe which uſurpe power over you, are of a Country where every body would raigne; thence it that there is not a City on the other ſide the Alpes, that hath not her republick or her petty King; and if your Majeſty had but a little taſted the Hiſtory of your owne Kingdome, you would
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:125863:97"/>have found that the moſt learned Tragedies that were ever ſeen in <hi>France,</hi> have come from that ſide: the laſt — upon occaſion of a lit-book which I publiſhed, touching <hi>Conſtancy and Comfort in publick ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities,</hi> I fear much that (contrary to my deſigne) this is a Work for your Reigne, if the goodneſs of God take not pity on us. Think not Sir, that the grief to ſee my ſelf removed from the State Affairs, breeds ſo bold a diſcourſe; if I had felt any grief for that, 'tis but as new married Wives weep to leave the ſubjection of their Fathers, to enter into the equality of Marriage: Yet it is true, that owing you my ſervice, I ſhould with more contentment have imployed it in your Counſels of State, then in your Parlaments, where the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are of leſſe importance. For I ſuppoſe, that if the Carpenter which made the frame of the Admirall wherein <hi>Don John de Auſtria</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded at the Battell of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> had known that ſhe ſhould have ſerved in ſo important an occaſion, wherein depended the ſafety of the reſt of Europe, hee would have taken more pleaſure in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her, then if he had made a veſſell deſtined onely for Traffick. Notwithſtanding, ſince your Majeſty commands mee to retire my ſelf, in a good hour be it, the leſſer ſtars bear a part in the perfection of the Univerſe, though they contribute leſſe to it then the Sun or Moon In what condition ſoever I live, I will ever bring all I ſhall be able to the good of your ſervice: and if there be any of thoſe which are neer you, that lament mine abſence, for my own ſake, I would willingly ſay to them, Weep for your ſelves, children of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> that for want of courage ſuffer your Majeſty to be betrayed; and not for me, that have no other fault, then that I am an honeſt man.

A while agoe he ſent a Gentleman expreſly to this Court, that it might not be contrary with the Marriage which he treated with <hi>Spaine,</hi> and to endeavour to make the <hi>Romans</hi> think well of it; and that one of theſe daies, it may be, he will call his Holineſſe, and the ſacred Colledge of Cardinals; but hitherto theſe are terms of a tongue unknowne to him. Furthermore, in this Country we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that there will be no lack of warrs till <hi>Rochel</hi> be reduced to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity: It is very true, that the forces which the King hath left before it, are not great; but for how many men think you, they count the Captaine into whoſe bands he hath put them! It is not permitted to judg of that which he will doe by the ordinary courſe of the things of this world, his actions cannot be drawn into example; and though he be infinitely wiſe, notwithſtanding it is certaine, that in what he undertakes, it alwaies appears ſomewhat greater then mans wiſdome; Yet truly my Lord, after having conſidered the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Stars which are ſo juſt; the order of the ſeaſons, which are ſo governed; the beauties of nature, which are ſo divers; I find in the end, that there is nothing in the world, where God ſheweth himſelf ſo admirable, as in the guiding of the life of my Lord your Father.

For the ſiege and Dike, they <hi>prae caeter is excellens,</hi> were in all parts moſt royall and farre more perfect and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niforme, then relation could make me conceive: The miſery of the ſiege almoſt incredible, but to ſuch only as have ſeene it, or ſome part thereof: Corn was worth after the rate of 800 Franks the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhel; an Oxe or Cow, ſold after the rate of 2000 Franks. The hoſt where I lay, ſold a Jade horſe, worth it may be four or five pounds, for 800 Franks, and for five and twenty weeks, taſted no bread: of twelve perſons in his family, only he and his wife are living; who alſo within two daies had dyed, if the Town had not been rendred. He and his wife made a Collation the day before the Town was rendred, which coſt him about ſix or ſeven pound ſterling; their chear was a pound of bread, made of Straw, Sugar, and other Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; halfe a pound of horſe fleſh, three or foure ounces of Comfits, and a pint of Wine, which they imagin'd, was the laſt good chear they ſhould make together; and in like caſe, were all the reſt of the Towne, only two or three families of the better ſort excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; by which you may conjecture what rates ſuch kind of proviſion were at. There were eaten between 3000 or 4000 Cow-hides, all the dogs, cats, mice and rats they could get, not a horſe left alive, which was food for the better ſort, only Madam <hi>Rohan,</hi> after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving eaten her Coach horſe, and her ſervants the Leather of her Coach; removed, though full ſore againſt her will, her lodging from <hi>Rochel</hi> to the Caſtle of <hi>Mooke</hi> or <hi>Ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There died for want of food in <hi>Rochel</hi> 15000 and reſted living when the King entred betweene three and four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, of which there are ſince very many dead; they dayly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver new miſeries, which when I was there, were not ſpoken of; the mother and the child at the breſt both dead, the child having eaten
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:125863:101"/>moſt part of the mothers breſt; a ſouldier was found dead with a piece of his fellows fleſh in his mouth; a Burger having a ſervant killed, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred her, which fed him and his wife a long time, and dainty meat too: many languiſhing and finding themſelves draw neer their ends, cauſed their coffins to be carried into the Churches, ſaid them down in them and ſo dyed; theſe were of the better ſort. The common ſort laid themſelves down in Coffins in the Church yards and there dyed; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the ſtreets, others not able to go out of their houſes dyed and remained there, their friends being not able to remove them thence. So that when the firſt Forces of the King entered, there were in the Town, of Corps unburied, ſome in the Church-yards, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the ſtreets, ſome in their houſes, ſome on the floore, others in their beds, beſides them that died without the Gates under hedges, and in ditches round about the Towne, which I ſaw my ſelfe when I was there; halfe devoured with Ravens and other beaſts, and fowls of the aire; In fine, the like miſery hath not been ſeene nor heard of.</p>
            <p>The King on All-Saints day, which was the day of his entry, with a wax Candle in his hand, together with the Cardinall and all the Nobility, in like manner, went all over the Town in proceſſion with the B. Sacrament. The chiefe Temple of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into a Church Cathedral, and <hi>Rochel</hi> to be a Biſhoprick. All the fortifications and walls to Landwards to be razed, and the Foſſes filled ſo that a plough may paſſe, as in arable Land. The Maior, with ſome of the chiefeſt, are baniſh'd for ever, others for a certaine time limited, though quietly to poſſeſſe their goods, moveable and immoveable, and a general remiſſion of all crimes paſt: and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that were in the Towne before the deſcent of the Engliſh into <hi>Rhee,</hi> and when the Town was rendred, ſhall likewiſe enjoy the ſame priviledge, though no child or heir abſent, is, or ſhall be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to inherit the goods or lands of his parents or friends deceaſed, but all is at the Kings diſpoſing. The King hath granted them free liberty of their Religion in the Town of <hi>Rochel,</hi> which in ſhort time will all be rooted out; for no Forrainer (though naturalized) ſhall be admitted to repair and inhabit in <hi>Rochel,</hi> nor <hi>French</hi> but <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks. The King hath added to the revenues of his Crown 20000 Franks <hi>per annum,</hi> which was a rent belonging to the Town-houſe, for the maintenance of the fortifications and State of <hi>Rochel.</hi> The Town-houſe is to be razed, and a pillar or pyramids with an ample in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the particulars of the ſiege and rebellion, there to be erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The forts of the Iſle of <hi>Rhee</hi> and <hi>Oleron,</hi> to be razed, &amp; (as it is ſaid)
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:125863:102"/>moſt of all the chief forts of <hi>France,</hi> except on the frontiers. Four Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are yet in <hi>Rochel,</hi> the reſt of the Army (at leaſt the moſt part) are gon to winter in thoſe parts of <hi>France,</hi> towards the coaſts of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> to be ready on all occaſions to ſuccor the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> as it is thought. The Fathers of the ſociety have very faire buildings gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them for their eſtabliſhing there, and 1000 Franks to begin to build; to which is added a revenue which I know not, the place is ſaid to be where the Hereticks kept their ſchools of Divinity, and Councel of warre, or rebellion. And where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had their Church, the <hi>Oratorians</hi> are likewiſe eſtabliſhed with large augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; The Capuchins are where was the chiefeſt Fort, called <hi>Le Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion de Levangile;</hi> The Minors are where the Dike was, and divers other elſewhere. There are at leaſt 8000 houſes in <hi>Rochel,</hi> which are faine to fall to the King to diſpoſe of for want of heirs. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſians are preparing a moſt ſumptuous and magnificent receipt for the King, which is the cauſe he hath not been at <hi>Paris</hi> ſince his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>Rochel,</hi> but is at <hi>St. Germins,</hi> and thereabouts, till all things are ready for his entry, which is thought will exceede in bravery and magnificence all the preſidents of many years. The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are by the body of <hi>Paris</hi> imployed to make the ſpeeches and inſcriptions for that purpoſe, which the body of the <hi>Sorbon</hi> take ill; The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> doth daily get ground of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and hath lately taken priſoners (as it is ſaid) thirty Captaines and eight hundred ſouldiers.

And for as much as the greateſt ſupport which God hath raiſed unto them upon earth is the ſuccour our Churches have, and do look to receive from your Majeſty, the general Aſſembly hath deſired that my Letters, which alone hitherto have repreſented unto your Majeſty the intereſt of the publick cauſe, might be joyned to their moſt humble ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons put up to your Majeſty. I do it Sir, with ſo much the more affection, becauſe I am a witneſſe that theſe poor people, who with ſighes and groanes implore your aſſiſtance, having once laid down their weapons which the oppreſsion of their enemies made ſo neceſſary, becauſe they knew ſuch was your deſire to take them up again, ſo ſoon as they heard that your Majeſty did oblige them thereunto by your Counſel and Promiſes; they have upon this only aſſurance, continued all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ſurmounted all oppoſitions, accounted their eſtates as nothing, and are ſtill ready to ſpend their bloud till the very laſt drop; they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem your love and favour more precious then their own lives, and whatſoever promiſes or threatnings have been uſed to ſhake their conſtant reſolution, they could never be brought to make any breach in that they had tyed themſelves to, never to hear of any Treaty without your conſent. This great zeal for the preſervation of all the Churches of this Kingdome, which is naturally knit to the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe few we have left, and that fidelity with our example, are worthy and glorious ſubjects to exerciſe your Charity and Power. You are (Sir) Defender of that Faith whereof they make profeſsion, ſuffer it not to be ſo unjuſtly oppreſſed; you have ſtirred up their affection in this defence by your royal promiſes, and thoſe Sacred
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:125863:104"/>words, that your Majeſty would imploy all the power in your Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to warrant and protect all our Churches from the ruine that threatned them, have been (after Gods favour) the onely foundation of all their hope: ſo the Churches ſhould thinke no greater a Crime could be committed by them, then doubt of your Royal performance thereof, if their miſeries and Calamities have at the beginning moved your Compaſſion. This wofull ſubject hath increaſed with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that nothing but your ſuccor can prevent their utter undoing: for at this day the greateſt offence our Enemies lay to our Charge, (and proclaim nothing can expiate but our blood) is, to have implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red your aid, and hope for it: for this cauſe, our Lands and Poſſeſſions are taken away and deſtroyed; our houſes made deſolate, and reduced to aſhes; our heads expoſed to ſale to murtherers; our families baniſhed; and whereſoever the cruelty of them that hate us can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, men and women are dragged and beaten to Maſs with Baſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>does. To be ſhort, the horrour of the perſecution we ſuffer is ſo great, that our words are too weak to expreſs it. Moreover, we ſee great and mighty Armies at our Gates, that waite their onely fit time to fall with impetuoſity upon the places of retreat that remain; and after that, to expel and baniſh the exerciſe of Religion, and maſſacre all the faithfull ones throughout the whole kingdomes. Theſe things conſidered (Sir) I do beſeech your Majeſty not to forſake us. I ſhould feare by ſuch words to offend ſo great, ſo potent, and ſo faithfull a king; But becauſe of urgent neceſſity that preſſeth us, I have preſumed importunately to intreat the haſtening of your aſſiſtance, to keep us from falling under the heavy burthen of our Enemies endeavors. Your Majeſty need not to draw, but out of the ſource of your own profound wiſedom, for the fit meanes how to make your ſuccor dreadfull and powerfull to thoſe that contemne it, and ſalutiferous to ſo many people that wait and long for it. Your Majeſty ſhall by this meanes acquire the greateſt glory that can be deſired, pluck out from the fire and ſword three hundred thouſand families that continually pray to God for your proſperity; preſerve a people whom God hath purchaſed with his moſt pretious blood, and which hath (even in the middeſt of moſt eminent dangers, and cruelleſt torments) kept intire a ſound and an upright faith, both towards God and man; you ſhall ſettle the fidelity of your word, the reputation of your kingdomes and Armes, to a pitch worthy of your grandeur; and in repreſſing of the audaciouſneſs of thoſe that go about every day to blemiſh the ſame, through their vile and unworthy reproches, you ſhal add to your titles that of the Reſtorer of a people,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:125863:105"/>the moſt innocent and moſt barbarouſly perſecuted that ever was. In that which concerns me, Sir, I will not make mention to your Majeſty of my owne Intereſt, though I might doe it, having, as it ſeems, the honor be unto you what I am: but I have ſo long ſince conſecrated all things with my ſelfe to the publicke good, that I ſhall eſteeme my ſelf happie enough, ſo that the Church were not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably diſtreſſed; and that I may have this advantage, that through my actions (which your Majeſtie will not diſavow) I may make it known, that I am</p>

            <p> THe protection of the Orthodox Religion in the moſt ſpacious Kingdoms of <hi>Spain,</hi> we think to be happily committed to your Fraternity: for we know with what watchful vigilancie, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned ſtation, you are careful that Monſters of wicked doctrine ſteal not into the bounds of the Church and Vine. But at this time occaſion from heaven is offered you, by which you may extend the benefits of your piety beyond the bounds of thoſe Kingdoms, and extend them alſo to forraign Countries. We underſtand that the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> the King of <hi>Great Britains</hi> ſon, is lately arrived there, carried with a hope of Catholike Marriage: Our deſire is, that he ſhould not ſtay in vain in the Courts of thoſe Kings, to whom the defence of the Popes authority, and care of advancing Religion, hath procured the renowned name of <hi>Catholique.</hi> Wherefore by Apoſtolike Letters we exhort his Catholike Majeſtie, that he would gently endeavour ſweetly to reduce that Prince to the obedience of the Romane Church, to which the ancient Kings of <hi>Great Britain</hi> have (with heavens approbation) ſubmitted their Crowns and Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters.

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:125863:105"/>what power and art you have, we have well known long ago: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we wiſh you to go like a religious Counſellor to the Catholike King, and to try all ways which by this preſent occaſion may benefit the Kingdoms of <hi>Britain</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The matter is of great weight and moment, and therefore not to be amplified with words. Whoſoever ſhall enflame the minde of this Royal youth with the love of the Catholike Religion, and breed a hate in him of Heretical impiety, ſhall begin to open the Kingdom of heaven to the Prince of <hi>Britain,</hi> and to gain the Kingdoms of <hi>Britain</hi> to the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like See; into the poſſeſſion of ſo great glory, I make no doubt but that your Fraternity, armed with the ſword of Verity, will be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to come.

            <p> MOſt dear Son in Chriſt, Health, and Apoſtolical benediction. The high exploits of your Royal valour, which have drawn upon them all the eyes of Chriſtendom, bring a great deal of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to our fatherly care, as well in regard of the glory of your Arms, as the hope of your triumphs. For conſidering, as we do, with much grief, the impiety of Hereticks, living in ſome places without fear or danger, we now thank the Lord of hoſts, that hath in ſo fit an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity made your Majeſtie to maintain with Arms the dignity of the Catholike Religion. Oh fair Apprentiſhip of Royal Warfare, and worthy of a moſt Chriſtian King! What an admirable thing it is, that the age which other Princes, out of a kinde of ſoftneſs and idleneſs, uſe to paſs away in ſports and delights, your Majeſty ſhould employ ſo generouſly, ſo fortunately, in appeaſing differen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:125863:106"/>Is it almoſt credible, that the very firſt ſteps of your thoughts ſhould carry you in ſo high and troubleſome an enterprise; and that the dangers and difficulties which have ſtopt others in their courſe, ſhould onely ſerve for a ſpur to the greatneſs of your courage? Enjoy (dear Son) the Renown your name hath got, and follow the God that fights for you; to the end that as you are now held the Thunderbolt and Buckler of War, ſo you may hereafter be eſteemed the praiſe of Iſrael, and the glory of the world. From the height of our Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Dignity, whereto if hath pleaſed God of his goodneſs to raiſe us, unworthy of ſo great grace, we aſſiſt your Arms with heart and affection, and by our frequent prayers prepare the divine remedies, And though we doubt not but your own vertue will make you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in the work you have begun, nevertheless we have thought good to adde Exhortations, that the world may ſee the care we have of the advancement of true Religion, and how willing we are to give way to your glory. You have been hitherto infinitely, bound to God for his bounty towards you; and, as we hope and wiſh, you ſhall hereafter a great deal more. For you having your minde endued with celeſtial doctrine, and not with the bare precepts of humane wiſdom, do well know, that Kingdoms have their foundation upon the truth of Orthodox faith: and unleſs God keep the City, what principality can ſubſiſt with any aſſurance? It may eaſily be judged with what fidelity they are likely to defend your Royal Throne, that have caſt the very Saints themſelves out of their Temples, and done as much as in them lay to put them out of the number of the bleſſed, yea out of Paradiſe it ſelf, that with impious temerity condemn the Inſtitutions of our Fathers, the Cuſtom of Kings, the Decrees of Popes, and the Ceremonies of the Church. Theſe are the diſturbers of the Chriſtian Commonwealth, and the reproaches of <hi>France,</hi> whom the great God hath reſerved, to be exterminated, as it were, in the beginning of your Raign. Know then, that all <hi>Europe</hi> (which the event of your Arms holds all this time in ſuſpence) hopes ſhortly it will hoyſe ſail upon the Ocean under the conduct of your Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Power, and go to the place which ſerves now for Sanctuary and protection to the Hereticks and Rebels, and it will ſhortly ſerve for a Trophie of your Victories. We are confidently perſwaded, that neither fear nor inconſtancie ſhall ever be able to divert you from the purſuit of your ſo glorious enterpriſe, nor hinder you to ſubvert that unſanctified people: Onely, by the way, we would have you remember, that the Saints in heaven aſſiſt that Prince who takes upon him the defence of Religion, and fight on his ſide like
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:125863:106"/>fellow-ſouldiers. The ſame God that hardned the waters like dry land, and turned the waters of the Sea into walls, to give ſafe paſſage to his childrens Army, will certainly in this moſt pious action be as favourable to you: and then we ſhall have good cauſe to hope, that having eſtabliſht your own Kingdom, and cruſht the impiety that was and yet is there, you may one day, by the progreſs of your victorious Arms, joyn the Orient to the Occident; imitating the glories of your Anceſtors, who have ever born as much reſpect to the Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Popes, as to the commandment of God. St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> whoſe name you bear, and whoſe ſteps you follow, invites you to it: ſo did the firſt of your Race, who in defending the Apoſtolike authority, and propagating Chriſtian Religion, laid the beſt and ſureſt founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to your Royal Houſe. Follow (dear Son) which are the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world, the commandments of heaven: pour out your wrath and indignation upon thoſe people that have not, nor will not know God, and our Apoſtolike benignity; to the end the divine trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of heaven may belong unto you by a juſt acquiſition. In the mean time, we ſend you moſt affectionately our Apoſtolike benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

            <p>WEE being deſirous of nothing more then the advancing of the good peace and proſperity of our people, have given leave to free debates of higeſt point of our prerogative Royal, which in the times of our Predeceſſors, Kings and Queens of this Realm, were ever reſtrained as matter they would not have diſputed; and in other things we have been willing ſo farre to deſcend to the deſires of our good ſubjects, as might fully ſatisfie all moderate minds, and free them from all juſt feares and jealouſies, which thoſe meſſages we have ſent unto the Commons Houſe wil well demonſtrate to the world; and yet we find it ſtil inſiſted on, That in no caſe whatſoever, ſhould it never ſo neerly concerne matters of State and Government, we or our privy Counſel have power to commit any man without the cauſe be ſhewed. The ſervice it ſelfe would be thereby deſtroyed and deſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and the cauſe it ſelfe muſt be ſuch as may be determined by our Judges of our cauſes at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in a legal and ordinary way of Juſtice; whereas the cauſe may be ſuch, as theſe Judges have not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:125863:115"/>of Judicature, nor rules <hi>of Law,</hi> to direct and guide their Judgments in caſes of tranſcedent nature, which happening ſo often, the very intermitting of the conſtant rules of Government for ſo many ages within this Kingdome practiſed, would ſoone diſſolve the very frame and foundation of our Monarchy; wherefore as to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons we made faire propoſition, which might equally preſerve the juſt liberties of the ſubject: So my Lords, we have thought good to let you know, that without the overthrow of our ſoveraignty, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuffer this power to be impeached; yet notwithſtanding, to clear our conſcience and intentions, this we publiſh, that it is not in our heart or will, ever to extend our Royal power (ſent unto us from God) beyond the juſt rule of moderationin, any thing which ſhall be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our Lawes and Cuſtomes, wherein the ſafety of our people ſhal be our only aime. And we do hereby declare our Royal pleaſure and reſolution to be, which (God willing) we wil ever conſtantly continue and mantaine, that neither we nor our Privy Counſel ſhall, or will at any time hereafter commit or command to priſon, or otherwiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine the perſon of any for not lending mony unto us, or for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other cauſe which in our conſcience, doth concern the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, and ſafety of us and our people; we wil not be drawn to pretend any cauſe which in our conſcience is not, or is not expreſſed, which baſe thought we hope no man can imagine, can fall into our Royal breſt: and that in all cauſes of this nature which ſhall hereafter happen, we ſhall upon the humble Petition of the party, or addreſſe of our Judges unto us, readily and really expreſſe the true cauſe of their Commitment or reſtraint, ſo ſoone as with conveniency or ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the ſame is fit to be diſcloſed and expreſſed; and that in all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Criminal of ordinary Jurisdiction, our Judges ſhall proceede to the deliverance and bailment of the Priſoner, according to the known and ordinary rules of the Lawes of this Land; and according to the Statute of <hi>Magna charta,</hi> and thoſe other ſix ſtatutes inſiſted on, which we do take knowledge ſtand in full force, and which we intend not to weaken, or abrogate againſt the true intent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>

            <p>AT this Sitting the Lord Viſcount <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> declared, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty being informed of the bold and open repaire made to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, and ſpecially to the houſes of forraine Ambaſſadors, for the hearing of Maſſe, which the Lawes and Statutes of this Kingdome do expreſly forbid his Subjects to frequent: and conſidering in his Princely wiſdome, both the publick Scandals, and dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof, is reſolved to take preſent order for the ſtopping of this evil before it ſpread it ſelfe any further, and for this purpoſe had commanded him to acquaint the Board with his pleaſure in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, and what courſe he thinketh fit to be held therein; and withal to demand the opinion and advice of their Lordſhips concerning the ſame, his Majeſty being deſirous to uſe the beſt and moſt effectuall expedient that can be found. Hereupon his Lordſhip proceeding, did further declare, that his Majeſty (to ſhew the clearneſſe and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his intention herein) hath begun at his owne houſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Whereſoever the Queens Majeſty hath any Chappel being intended for the only ſervice of her, and for thoſe French who attend her; for which the Earl of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> Lord Chamberlaine to her Majeſty, hath been commanded to take ſpecial care; according to ſuch directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as he hath received from his Majeſty. That for ſo much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:125863:116"/>the repaire to the houſes of Forraine Embaſſadors at the time of Maſſe, his Majeſty thinks fit that ſome meſſengers of the Chamber, or other officers or perſons fit for that ſervice, ſhall be appointed to watch all the ſeveral paſſages to their houſes, and without entring into the ſaid houſes, or infringing the freedoms and priviledges belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto them, obſerve ſuch perſons as go thither, but at their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from thence, they are to apprehend them and bring them to the Board; and ſuch as they cannot apprehend, to bring their names. But to the end that the ſaid Forraine Embaſſadours may have no cauſe to complaine of this proceeding; as if there were any intention to wrong or diſreſpect them, his Majeſty doth likewiſe think fit, that for the preventing of any ſuch miſtaking and ſiniſter Interpretation, the ſaid Embaſſadors ſhall be acquainted with the truth of this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and likewiſe aſſured in his Majeſties name, that he is, and wil be as careful to conſerve all priviledges and rights belonging to the quality of their places, as any of his Progenitors have been, and in the ſame manner as himſelfe expecteth that their Princes ſhall uſe to wards his Embaſſadors.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, That it is his Majeſties expreſſe pleaſure that the like dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence be uſed for the apprehending of all ſuch as repaire to Maſſe in priſons or other places.</p>
            <p>The Board having heard this declaration, did unanimouſly conclude, that there could sot be taken a more effectuall courſe for the preventing of theſe evils, then this which his Majeſty in his wiſedome hath ſet downe, and therefore did order that the ſame be immediately put in ſtrict and careful execution. And it was likewiſe thought fit, that the Lord Viſcount <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Secretary Cooke,</hi> ſhould be ſent to the forraine Embaſſadours ſeverally, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them with his Majeſties intention, as is before mentioned; and that the meſſengers of the Chamber to be imployed in the ſervice before ſpecified ſhall be appointed and receive their charge from the Lord Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Lord Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and the Secretaries, who are to take a ſpeciall care to ſee this put in execution.</p>

But beholding the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Armies of the Emperour in <hi>Italy,</hi> and with extreme griefe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing the harmes, inconveniences and dangers that <hi>Italy</hi> muſt thereby ſuffer in matter of Religion, being that which moſt importeth; I doe not only reſent it, in reſpect of that portion which God hath given me in Chriſtendome, but eſpecially as a King and Prince of <hi>Italy,</hi> the peace of thoſe Provinces being diſturbed, which my Progenitors with ſo much Judgment and providence, and with ſo much Authority and benefit of the Natives had ſo many years preſerved. Wherefore I thought it my duty to preſent unto your beatitude that experience hath demonſtrated that to oppoſe and ſtraighten the Jurisdiction of the Emperour, and to reſiſt his commandments, hath brought matters
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:125863:117"/>to theſe difficult terms, and this way being ſtill perſiſted in, there muſt needs follow thoſe miſchief<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which we deſire to ſhun. Now the moſt convenient manner how to compoſe theſe buſineſſes, is that your Holineſſe doe effectually perſwade the Duke of Nivers to accomodate himſelf to the Juſtice and obedience of the Emperour, and the King of <hi>France</hi> to recall his Armies out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Princes that doe aid Nivers, no more to intereſt themſelves in the buſineſſe, even as from the beginning my Miniſters have propounded to your Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; becauſe this difference being ended juridically, all the perſons intereſſed ſhall come off with honour and reputation, and ſo all of them ſhall have a ground to beſeech the Emperour, that out of his wonted clemency, he wil take off that impreſſion, which he juſtly might have conceived againſt the Duke of <hi>Nivers;</hi> whereupon things incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to this iſſue, I ſhal with a very good will imploy my beſt offices to the end that ſpeedy and exact juſtice may be adminiſtred, and alſo that his <hi>Caeſarian</hi> Majeſty may give experimental effects of his magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity and ſtability, deſiring with a moſt ſincere affection, that ſo much Chriſtian blood may be ſpared, as would be ſpilt in this war, and that thoſe forces might be imployed to the ſervice, and not to the prejudice of Chriſtendome. Thus have I cleerly and ſincerely delivered my meaning unto your Holineſſe, to the end that knowing my intention, you may do thoſe offices which your manifold wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhall find proper for the place whereto God hath advanced you; and if God for our ſins have decreed to chaſtiſe Chriſtendome, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the war; let this diſpatch be a teſtimony of my good wil, and real intention towards peace; for the proſecuting whereof, I on my part, will alwaies imbrace any reaſonable and proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanes.

            <p>we ſtand ſo bounden to your royall Self, and your moſt bleſſed Father our late deceaſed Soveraigne Lord and Maſter, as we are urged in duty to proſtrate this act of our faith at your Majeſties feet, as an aſſay to cleer ſome things wherein miſinformation may ſeem to have approached your high Wiſdome. We underſtand that it is collected out of ſome
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:125863:118"/>late Diſpatches from hence, that there are ſuch diſorders in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment here, as by the preſent Governors are remedileſſe; all which is aſcribed to the differences between perſons of chief place; We do in all humility teſtifie and declare that we have not ſeen or known any inconvenience to the publick ſervice by the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your Majeſties Deputy and Chancellor, neither have of late ſeen or heard any act or ſpeech of contention between them. Other difference between perſons of any eminent Action wee underſtand none, neither are any diſorders here yet ſo overgrown, as co ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the redreſſe of the preſent Governour, eſpecially ſo long as he hath ſuch a ſtanding Engliſh Army, as your Majeſty now alloweth; if only we may receive ſome ſupply of Armes and munition, which we have often written for, do daily expect, and which ſhall be no loſſe to your Majeſty. It is true, moſt gracious Soveraign, that in ſome late diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches we mentioned three grievances in this government, which in extent may threaten much, if we be not timely directed from thence concerning them, <hi>viz.</hi> the inſolence and excreſcence of the Popiſh pretended Clergie, the diſorder and offence of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Regiment, and the late outragious preſumption of the unſetled Iriſh, in ſome parts; towards all which (being parties perhaps otherwiſe conceived of there, then underſtood here) your Deputy and Councel have of late uſed particular abſtinence, holding themſelves ſomewhat limited concerning them, by late Inſtructions, Letters and directions from thence. And therefore leſt countenance of that courſe, might turn to greater damage, we make choice ſeaſonably to crave expreſſion of the good pleaſure of your Highneſſe, and the moſt Honourable Lords of your Councel, leſt our actions and zeal therein might vary from the purpoſes on that ſide, and ſo want of unanimity in both States, breake the progreſſe of the Reformation; not that we any way make doubt to give your Majeſtly a good accompt of our ſelves therein, and of the ful eviction of thoſe evils in due time, ſo we might be aſſured of your Majeſtys and their Lordſhips good allowance of our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, being confident in all humility, to declare and affirme to your Sacred Majeſty, that the reſt of this great body, (as to the civil part thereof) is in far better order at this time, then ever it was in the memory of man; as wel in the current and general execution of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice according to the Lawes, in the freedome of mens perſons and eſtates, (the preſent charge of the Army excepted) and in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal outward ſubjection of all ſorts of ſetled inhabitants to the Crowne and Lawes of <hi>England,</hi> and alſo in the advancement of the Crowne Revenues; and laſtly, in the competent number of Biſhops, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:125863:118"/>able and Learned Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> of all ſorts, which we eſpecially attribute to the bleſſedneſſe of your time, and to the Induſtryes, Zeale, Judgment and moderation of your Deputy, as well in your Majeſty ſervice, as towards this people<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, having now well learned this great office; and to the good beginnings of the two laſt precedent Deputies under direction of your moſt Renowned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we underſtand that your Deputy and Councel are blamed for the preſent ſurcharge of your Revenues here, far beyond the ſupport thereof.</p>
            <p>Herein your Royal Majeſty may be pleaſed to cauſe a review of our diſpatch from hence, in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1627. wherein it wil appear; that their part in that offence hath been only obedience to extraordinary warrants from thence, and that if thoſe warrants had not beene fully performed out of your Revenues, you had had about 40000 pound Iriſh to pay penſioners, in your Coffers, and anſwer other neceſſities which have ſince increaſed.</p>
            <p>So as we humbly crave pardon freely to affirme, that the fault hath not been here; and further alſo to ſay for your Majeſties honour and our comfort, that during 200 years laſt paſt, <hi>England</hi> hath never been ſo free of the charge of Ireland, as now it is.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we underſtand that your Deputy is accuſed for miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in the legal proſecution of <hi>Phelim Mach Fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Herein we moſt humbly beſeech your Majeſty, that a review may be of a declaration ſent from hence about the beginning of your Deputies government, ſigned hy him and all the Counſel then here, whereby wil appear how the parts of <hi>Lemſter,</hi> at leaſt, have been from age to age infeſted by him and his predeceſſors, and the inhabitants of the territory of <hi>Ranelagh,</hi> wherein he tooke upon him a Chiefery; and therein will alſo appeare, that it was the ſpecial affection and endeavour of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral worthy Deputies here to have cleared that offenſive plot, which no wiſe State could ſuffer ſo neer the ſeat thereof, and that they alſo ſeverally attempted it by force, the ſaid <hi>Phelims</hi> Father being ſlain by actuall Rebellion by Sir <hi>William Ruſſels</hi> proſecution; but the generall Rebellion of the Kingdome alwaies interrupted the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement thereof. This being at that time the declaration of the State; moved your Deputy, being a ſtranger, to have a wary aſpect upon the people, for the Common peace, which he hath carefully perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Afterwards at the time when the general voice was amongſt the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would be here, your Deputie had cauſe
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:125863:119"/>to examine ſeveral perſons and cauſes concerning that Rumour wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by fell out to be diſcovered to him among others, that this <hi>Phelim</hi> had confederated for raiſing a Commotion in <hi>Lemſter,</hi> and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Miniſter, and Juſtice of peace (a ready inſtrument in Crown Cauſes) inhabiting about the border of the ſaid territory. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which time, we never heard of any diſpleaſure or hard meaſure born by your ſaid Deputy to him, or offence taken by him, at any particular done to him, unleſs he were offended that your Deputy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed his mony offered to blanch your Majeſties title to the Lands in <hi>Ranlagh,</hi> now granted to undertakers, diſcovered and proſecuted at firſt by his brother <hi>Redmond</hi> and his Councel <hi>Peter de la Hoyd,</hi> We do alſo herein in all humility teſtifie, and declare that he acquainted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Privy Councellors here, and others of Judgment with the ſame. And alſo in every Act and paſsage thereof uſed the labour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, either of your Majeſties Privy Concellours, Judges, or learned Councel, alwaies profeſſing publickly and privately (which we alſo in our conſciences do believe) that he had no particular envy or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure to <hi>Phelims</hi>'s perſon, or any of his, neither had any end in what might fall out upon that diſcovery or pains, or any act done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that Country, other then the reducement thereof, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of other civil parts; the common peace of your Majeſties good Subjects adjacent, and the legal and plenary effecting of that which by ſo many good governours in times of diſturbance could not be done, there being no power in him to make any particular benefit of the Eſcheate, either in lands or goods; and before any thing was to be done for the tryal of him and the reſt for their lives, he made a ſpeedy and immediate addreſs to your Majeſty, dated 27. <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1628 upon the indictment found, to inform you of the then preſent eſtate of that buſineſſe, which we have ſeen, not doing it before (as he affirms) for that he had formerly received gracious approbations of his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in the like diſcoveries.</p>
            <p>We alſo in all humbleneſſe and duty do declare and proteſt, that if upon their evil demerits, and the due proceedings of Law, thoſe now queſtioned may be taken away, and the Territory ſettled in legal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Engliſh order, (towards which a ſtrong Fort is already almoſt built in the midſt of it by your Majeſties Undertakers lately planted there: It will be a ſervice of the greateſt importment to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the Iriſh, aſſure the inhabitants of other Parts, and ſtrengthen the generall peace of the Kingdom (next to the great Plantation of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>) that hath been done in this age. If otherwiſe they ſhall by fair tryall acquit the courſe of your Majeſties free and indifferent juſtice,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:125863:119"/>it will make them wary in point of duty and loyalty hereafter. And we do further in all ſubmiſſion declare, That in theſe diſcoveries, (the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Cauſes conſidered) it was of neceſſity that the perſonal pains of your Highneſs Deputy ſhould be beſtowed; the rather, for that the Evidences being to be given for the moſt part by perſons involved in the ſame confederacyes, and who were to become actors, they would not be drawn to confeſs truths to any inferior Miniſters, being of ſtubborn and malign ſpirits; beſides the diſſwaſions of Prieſts, and of the Dependants and manifold Allies of the ſaid <hi>Phelim,</hi> if they had not been warily look'd after.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, We in all humbleneſſe of heart and freedom of faithful ſervants, do beſeech your moſt ſacred Majeſty to conſider how much the ſufferings of your zealous ſervants may prove to your diſſervice, eſpecially in this place, where diſcouragement of your moſt dextrous ſervice is moſt aimed at by multitudes of ſeveral qualities, and cannot but ſoon perplex the preſent happy ſtate of your affairs. Wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech the eternall God to guide and proſper your Majeſties advices and deſignes.</p>

            <p>In this Staff the Author ſeemeth to me to proceed in a differing manner from what he doth elſewhere generally through his whole
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:125863:122"/>booke; for in other places, although the beginning of this Allegorie or miſtical ſenſe may be obſcure, yet in the proceſſe of it he doth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe declare his owne conceptions in ſuch ſort, that they are obvious to any ordinary capacity: But in this, he ſeemeth only to glance at the profoundeſt notions that any ſcience can deliver to us; and then of a ſuddaine, as it were recalling himſelf out of an Enthuſiaſme, he returneth to the gentle relation of the Allegorical hiſtory that he had begun, leaving his readers to wander up and down in much obſcurity, and to rove with much danger of erring at his intention in theſe lines; which I conceive to be dictated by ſuch a learned ſpirit, and ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a knowing ſoule, that were there nothing elſe extant of <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> writings, yet theſe few words would make me eſteeme him no whit inferiour to the moſt famous men that ever have been in any age, as giving an evident teſtimony herein, that he was throughly verſed in the Mathemeticall ſciences, in Philoſophy and Divinity, unto all which this might ſerve for an ample Theame to make large Commentaries upon; In my praiſes upon this ſubject I am confident, that the worth of the Author will preſerve me from this cenſure, that my ignorance only begetteth this admiration, ſince he hath written nothing that is not admirable. But that it may appeare, I am guided ſomewhat by my owne Judgement, (although it be a very meane one) and not by implicit faith, and that I may in the beſt manner I can comply with what you may expect from me, I will not longer hold you in ſuſpence, but begin immediately (though abruptly) with the declaration of what I conceive to be the true ſenſe of this place; which I ſhall not goe about to adorne with any plauſible diſcourſes, or with authorities and examples drawne from others writings; (ſince my want both of conveniency and learning would make me fall very ſhort herein) but it ſhall bee enough for me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate my conceptions, and to offer them up unto you in their own ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and naked forme, leaving to your better Judgment, the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the waight of them; and after peruſal of them, beſeeching you to reduce me, if you perceive me to erre. It is evident, that the Authors intention in this Canto, is to deſcribe the body of man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with a rational ſoule; and in proſecution of that deſigne, he ſetteth down particularly the ſeveral parts of the one, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the other. But in this <hi>Stanza</hi> he comprehended the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deſcription of them both, as (being joyned together to frame a compleat man) they make one perfect compound, which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear bettter by taking a ſurvey of every ſeveral Clauſe thereof by it ſelfe.</p>
            <pb n="246" facs="tcp:125863:123"/>
            <q>
               <l>The frame thereof ſeem'd partly circuler,</l>
               <l>And part trianguler.—</l>
            </q>
            <p>By theſe figures, I conceive that he meaneth the Mind and the Body of man, the firſt being by him compared to a Circle, and the latter to a Triangle; for as the Circle of all figures is the moſt perfect, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth the greateſt ſpace, and is every way full, and without angles, made by the continuation of one onely line; ſo mans ſoul is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt and moſt beautiful creature that God hath created, and by it we are capable of the greateſt gifts which God can beſtow, which are Grace, Glory, and Hypoſtatical union of the humane Nature to the divine: and ſhe enjoyeth perfect freedom and liberty in all other actions, and is made without compoſition, (which no figures are that have angles; for they are cauſed by the coincidence of ſeveral lines) but of one pure ſubſtance, which was by God breathed into a body made of ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded earth, as in the preceding Stanza the Author deſcribeth; and this is the exact image of him that breached it, repreſenting him as ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it is poſſible for any creature, which is infinitely diſtant from the Creator. For as God hath neither beginning nor ending, ſo neither of theſe can be found in a Circle; although that being made of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive motion of a line, it muſt be ſuppoſed to have a beginning ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. God is compared to a circle whoſe center is every where, but whoſe Circumference no where; but mans ſoul is a circle whoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference is limited by the true center of it, which is only God. For as a circumference doth in all parts alike reſpect that indiviſible point, and as all lines drawn from the inner ſide of it, do make right angles with it when they meet therein; ſo all the interior actions of mans ſoul ought to have no other reſpective point to direct themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to but God: and as long as they make right angles, which is, that they keep the exact middle of vertue, and decline not to either of the ſides where the contrary vices dwell, they cannot fail but meet in their Center.</p>
            <p>By the Trianguler figure he very aptly deſigneth the Body: For as the Circle is of all other figures the moſt perfect, and moſt capacious; ſo the Triangle is the moſt imperfect, and includeth the leaſt ſpace: It is the firſt and loweſt of all figures; for fewer then three right lines cannot comprehend and incloſe a ſuperficies; having but three angles, they are all acutes (if it be equilateral) and but equall to two right ones; in which reſpect all other regular figures conſiſting of more then three lines, do exceed it: May not theſe be reſembled to the three great and compounded Elements in mans body, to wit, Sale, Sulphur, and Mercury? which mingled together, do make the natural heat,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:125863:123"/>and radicall moiſture, the two qualities whereby man liveth: for the more lines that do go to comprehend a figure, the more and greater the angles are, and the neerer it cometh to the perfection of a Circle.</p>
            <p>A Triangle is compoſed of ſeveral lines, and they of points which yet do not make a quantity by being contiguous one to another, but rather the motion of them doth deſcribe the lines. In like manner the Body of man is compounded of the four Elements, which are made by the four primary qualities, not compounded of them (for they are but accidents;) but by their operation upon the firſt matter.</p>
            <p>And as a Triangle hath three lines, ſo a ſolid body hath three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions, to wit, Longitude, Latitude, and Profundity: but of all bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies mans is of the loweſt rank (as the Triangle is among figures) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compoſed of the Elements, which make it liable to alteration and corruption. In which conſideration of the dignity of bodies, I divide them by a general diviſion, into ſublunary, which are the elementated ones; and into the ethereal (which are ſuppoſed to be of their own nature incorruptible:) and peradventure there are ſome other ſpecies of corporeal ſubſtances, which is not in this place to diſpute.</p>
            <q>— O work Divine!</q>
            <p>Certainly of all Gods works the nobleſt and the perfecteſt is man; and for whom indeed all others were done; for if we conſider his ſoul, it is the very Image of God; if his body, it is adorned with the greateſt beauty and excellent ſymmetry of parts of any created thing, whereby it witneſſeth the perfection of the Architect, that of ſo droſſie mould is able to make ſo excellent a Fabrick: if his operations, they are free; if his end, it is eternal glory; and if you take him altogether, man is a little world, an exact type of the great world, and of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
            <p>But in all this me thinketh that the admirable worke is the joyning together of the two different, and indeed oppoſite ſubſtances in man to make one perfect compound; the ſoul and the body, which are of ſo contrary a nature, that their uniting ſeemeth to be a miracle: for how can one informe and work in the other, ſince there is no meane of operation (that we know) betweene a ſpiritual ſubſtance and a Corporal? yet we ſee that it doth. As hard it is to find the true proportion between a Circle and a Triangle, yet that there is a juſt proportion; and that they may be equal, <hi>Archimides</hi> hath left us an ingenious demonſtration: but in reducing it to a Probleme, it fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in this, That becauſe the proportion betweene a crooked line and a ſtraight one is not known, one muſt make uſe of a mechanical way of meaſuring the Peripherie of the one, to convert it into the ſide of the other.</p>
            <pb n="248" facs="tcp:125863:124"/>
            <q>Theſe two the firſt and laſt proportions are.</q>
            <p>What I have already ſaid concerning a Circle and a Triangle, doth ſufficiently unfold what is meant in this verſe; yet it will not be amiſſe to ſpeak one word more hereof in this place, All things that have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence may be divided into three Claſſes; which are, either what is pure and ſimple in it ſelf, or what hath a nature compounded of what is ſimple, or what hath a nature compounded of what is compounded. In continued quantity this may be exemplified by a point, a line, and a ſuperficies, or body; and in numbers by an Unity, a Denary, and a Centenary. The firſt, which is onely pure and ſingle, like an indiviſible point, or an Unity, hath relation onely to the Divine Nature; that point then moving in a ſphericall manner (which ſerveth to expreſs the perfections of Gods actions) deſcribeth the circle of our ſouls, and of Angels, and of intellectual ſubſtances, which are of a pure and ſimple nature; but receiveth that from what is ſo in a perfecter manner, and that hath his from none elſe: like lines that are made from the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of points, or denaries that are compoſed of unities, beyond both which there is nothing.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place bodies are to be ranked, which are compoſed of the Elements, and they likewiſe ſuffer compoſition, and may very well be compared to the loweſt of figures which are compoſed of lines, that owe their being to points (and ſuch are Triangles); or to Centenaries, that are compoſed of Denaries, and they of Unites: but if wee will compare theſe together by proportion, God muſt be left out, ſince there is an infinite diſtance between the ſimplicity and perfection of his nature, and the compoſition and imperfection of all created ſubſtances, as there is between an indiviſible point and a continuate quantity; or between a ſimple unity, and compounded number: ſo that onely the other two kindes of ſubſtances do enter into this conſideration, and of them I have already proved, that mans ſoule is of the one the nobleſt, being dignified by Hypoſtaticall union above all other intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual ſubſtances, and his elementated body of the other, the moſt low and corruptible; whereby it is evident, that theſe two are the firſt and laſt proportions both in reſpect of their owne figure, and of what they expreſſe.</p>
            <q>
               <l>The one imperfect, mortal, faeminine,</l>
               <l>Th'other immortal, perfect, maſculine.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Mans body hath all the properties of imperfect matter, it is but the patient, of it ſelf alone it can doe nothing, it is lyable to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſſolution if it once be deprived of the forme, which actuateth it ſelfe, and is incorruptible and immortal.</p>
            <pb n="249" facs="tcp:125863:124"/>
            <p>And as the feminine ſex is imperfect, and receiveth perfection from the maſculine, ſo doth the body from the ſoul, which to it is in lieu of a Male; and as in corporall generations the Female doth afford but groſſe and paſſive matter, unto which the Male giveth active heat and prolificall vertue; ſo in ſpirituall generations, (which are the operations of the Mind) the body adminiſtreth only the Organs, which if they were not imployed by the Soul, would of themſelves ſerve to nothing. And as there is a mutuall appetence between the male and the female; between matter and form, ſo there is between the body and ſoul of a man; but what ligament they have, that our Author defineth not; (and peradventure Reaſon is not able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine unto it) yet he telleth us what is the Foundation that this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine reſteth upon, and what keepeth the Parts together, in theſe words:</p>
            <q>And 'twixt them both a Quadrat was the baſe.</q>
            <p>By which Quadrat, I conceive, that he meaneth the four principall humours in mans body, to wit, Choler, Blood Flegme and Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; which if they be diſtempered and unfitly mingled the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole doth enſue; like to a building, which falleth to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine if the Foundation or Baſe of it be unſound or disordered: and in ſome of theſe the vitall ſpirits are contained and preſerved which the other do keep in a convenient temper; and as long as they do ſo the ſoul and body dwell together like good friends: So that theſe four are the Baſe of the conjunction of the other two; both which hee ſaith, are</p>
            <q>Proportion'd equally by Seven and Nine.</q>
            <p>In which words, I underſtand, that hee meaneth the influences of the ſuperior ſubſtances, which govern the inferiour into theſe two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering parts of man, to wit, of the Stars (the moſt powerfull of which are the ſeven Planets) into his body; and of the Angels (which are divided into nine Hierarchies or Orders) into the ſoul, which in his Aſtrophel he ſaith, is</p>
            <q>
               <l>By Soveraign choice from the Heavenly Quires ſelect,</l>
               <l>And lineally deriv'd from Angels race.</l>

            <p>The meſſengers to convey which ſoule into the body, are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences that move the Orbs of heaven, who according to their ſeveral natures do communicate unto it ſeveral proprieties, and they who are governors of thoſe Stars that have at that inſtant, the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority in the Planetary aſpects; whereby it cometh to paſſe that in all inclinations, there is much affinity betweene the ſoule and the body, being that the like is between the Intelligences and the Stars, both which communicate their vertues to each of them. And theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels being, as I ſaid before, of nine ſeverall Hierarchies, there are ſo many principal differences in humane ſouls, which doe participate moſt of their proprieties with whom in their deſcent they make longeſt ſtay, and that had moſt active power to work upon them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied them with a peculiar <hi>Genius;</hi> which is according to their ſeveral governments like the ſame kind of water that running through various conduits, wherein ſeveral aromatical and odoriferous things are laid, doth acquire ſeveral kinds of taſte and ſmells; for it is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:125863:125"/>that in their firſt Creation all ſoules are alike, and that their differing proprieteis arrive unto them afterwards, when they paſſe through the ſpheers of the governing Intelligences; ſo that by ſuch their influence it may truly be ſaid,</p>
            <q>Nine was the Circle ſet in heavens place.</q>
            <p>Which verſe by aſſigning his office to the nine, and the proper place of the Circle, doth give much light to what is ſaid before.</p>
            <p>And for further confirmation that this is he Authors opinion, read attentively the ſixth Canto of the third booke, where moſt learnedly and at large, he delivereth the Tenets of this Philoſophy; and of that, I recommend to you to take particular notice of the ſecond, and thirty ſecond Stanzaes, and alſo of the laſt ſtaffe of his <hi>Epithalamium;</hi> and ſurveying his workes, you ſhall find him a conſtant diſciple of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to's</hi> School.</p>
            <q>All which compacted, made a goodly Diapaſe,</q>
            <p>In nature there is not to be found a more complete and more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent concordance of all parts, then that which is betweene the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and uniting together of the body and ſoul of man, both which although they conſiſt of many and moſt differing faculties and parts, yet when they keepe due time with one another, do altogether make the moſt perfect harmony that can be imagined; and as the nature of ſounds, (that conſiſt of friendly conſonants and accords) is to mingle with one another, and to ſlide into the care with much ſweetneſſe, where by their unity they laſt a long time, and delight it; whereas on the contrary ſide, diſcords do continually jar, and fight together, and wil not mingle with one another, but all of them ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to have the victorie, their reluctation and diſorder giveth a ſoone end to their ſounds, which ſtrike the eare in a harſh and offenſive manner, and they die in the very beginning of their conflict. In like ſort, when a mans actions are regular, and that being directed towards God, they become like the lines of a Circle which all meet in the Center, then his muſick is excellent and compleat, and all together are the Authors of that bleſſed harmony which maketh him hapyy in the glorious viſion of Gods perfections, wherein the mind is filled with high knowledges and moſt pleaſing contemplations, and the ſenſes are as it were drowned with eternal delight; and nothing can inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt this joy, this happineſſe which is an everlaſting Diapaſe: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary part, if a mans actions be diſorderly and conſiſting; of diſcord, which is when the ſenſitive part rebelleth and wraſtleth with the rational, and ſtriveth to oppreſſe it, then this Muſick is ſpoiled and inſtead of eternal life, pleaſure, and joy, it cauſeth perpetuall
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:125863:126"/>death, horrour, paine, and miſery, which unfortunate eſtate the Poet deſcribeth elſewhere, as in the concluſion of this ſtaffe he intimateth.

I wil only beg pardon of you for this blotted and interlyned paper, whoſe contents are ſo meane, that it cannot deſerve the pains of a tranſcription, which if you make diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie to grant unto it for my ſake, let it obtaine it for having beene yours, and now returning againe to you, as alſo doth the booke that containeth my text which yeſterday you ſent me, to fit this part of it with a Comment: which peradventure I might have performed better, if either I had afforded my ſelfe more time, or had had the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſome other books apt to quicken my invention, to whom I might have been beholding, for enlarging my underſtanding in ſome things that are treated here, although the application ſhould ſtil have been my own; with theſe two helps, peradventure I might have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved farther into the Authors intention, the depth of which cannot be ſounded by any that is leſſe learned then he was.

            <head>Maſter Gargrave to the Lord Davers.</head>
            <p>MY very good Lord, I have heretofore many times both ſent and written to you touching the inſupportable burden of wrong which hath many years laine upon my ſhoulders, but you were not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to returne me any anſwer for my ſatisfaction therein: my opinion at the firſt, was, that it was meerly the reſpect of ſome, whom you would not, or might not offend, that you ſuffered your name to be uſed by others to wound and afflict me in my eſtate: to which ſo fair an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I was induced partly by ancient Judgment of your honourable diſpoſition, partly and much rather by the privity of my heart, which ever conſtantly affected a good correſpondency with you every way. But ſince now this oppreſſion which I ſuffer, hath had its continuance ſo many years without relaxation, in which I ſmart beyond all exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the admiration of the world hath concurred with my ſenſe of ſo great a bitterneſſe from ſo neere Allies; I cannot but to my griefe and wonder obſerve your too much either conſent or connivency to theſe my harms, which before I have not eaſily ſuffered my thoughts to admit; wherein if I have not miſtaken your Lordſhips intereſt, I have yet conceived hope, that although you had in the beginning a juſt ground to make the feele the weight of your diſpleaſure and alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from me, yet that the ſufferance of ſo many years, and ſuch a ſufferance under pretence of Juſtice, as can hardly be parallell'd, might yet at the laſt, have ſatiated a very deeply intended revenge, much more ſatisfied a moderate mind poſſeſſed with Honour or Religion, as I conceive your Lordſhips to be. Herein, after a various agitation in my ſelfe, I am enforced to honour the wonderful providence of God, who hath pleaſed to convert the affinity which I affected with your Noble houſe, for my comfort and aſſiſtance, to my ruine; and that in the boſome of our neereſt and deareſt friendſhip, ſhould breed ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine a hatred, as ſhould tend to the overthrow of my credit, wealth, lands, liberty, houſe, wife, and children, and all thoſe comforts which ſhould either ſupport or ſweeten the life of man.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I have adventure after ſo long ſilence, to minde your Lordſhip of this my unfortunate eſtate, wherein I rather die then live, whereunto I have been ſo long ſince precipitated by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips countenance, as I hope, pretended only by the inſtruments of my miſchiefe to proceede from you; that if now your Lordſhip ſhall think i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And it being notorious, that the ſame <hi>France,</hi> (after all theſe publick and manifeſt contraventions to the Treaties of Peace) hath finally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to a breach thereof: whereas we rather had cauſe to denounce the War, in that ſhe hath ſent her Armies to over-run the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, the Dutchie of <hi>Millain,</hi> and other Feoffs of the Empire in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and now lately the Country of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> contrary to the Lawes of Neutrality, contrary to the Publick Faith, and contrary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe promiſes of the Prince of <hi>Conde:</hi> Diſguiſing in the mean time, theſe attempts and breaches of Faith before all Chriſtendome, with certain weak pretexts and falſe ſurmiſes, contained in divers Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, approved in the Parliament of <hi>France;</hi> and accompanying all theſe unjuſt proceedings with ſundry Inſolencies, Calumnies and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of ſacred perſons. And having alſo obſerved, that this ſo long continence of ours at ſo manifold injuries hath ſerved to no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but to make our enemies more audacious and inſolent, and that the compaſſion we have had of <hi>France</hi> hath drawn on the ruine of thoſe
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:125863:127"/>whom God had put under the obedience of their Majeſties: For theſe conſiderations, according to the power which we have received from his Imperiall Majeſtie, we have commanded our Armies to enter into <hi>France,</hi> with no other purpoſe then to oblige the King of <hi>France</hi> to come to a good &amp; ſecure Peace, for removing thoſe impediments, which may hinder this ſo great a good. And for as much as it principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth <hi>France</hi> to give end to theſe diſorders, we are willing to believe that all the Eſtates of that Kingdome will contribute not only their remonſtrances, but alſo if need be, their forces to diſpoſe their King to Chaſtiſe thoſe who have been the Authors of all theſe Warrs, which theſe ſeven or eight years paſt have beene in Chriſtendome; and who after they have provoked and aſſayled all their neighbours, have brought upon France all thoſe evils which ſhe doth now ſuffer, and draw on her thoſe other which do now threaten her. And although we are well informed of the weakneſſe and deviſions, into which theſe great diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and evil counſels have caſt her; yet we declare, that the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Maſtjeſties, are not to ſerve themſelves of this occaſion to ruine her, or to draw from thence any other profit, then by that means to work a Peace in Chriſtendom, which may be ſtable and permanent.</p>
            <p>For theſe reaſons, and withal to ſhew what Eſtimation their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties do make of the prayers of the Queene Mother of the moſt Chriſtian King, wee doe give to underſtand, that we wil protect and treat as friends all thoſe of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, who either joyntly or ſeverally ſhall ſecond theſe our good deſignes; and have given Order that Neutrality ſhal be held with thoſe of the Nobility, and with the Townes which ſhal deſire it, and which ſhal refuſe to aſſiſt thoſe who ſhal oppoſe the good of Chriſtendome, and their own ſafety; againſt whom ſhall be uſed all manner of hoſtility, without giving quarter to their perſons, or ſparing either their houſes or goods. And our fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wil is, that all men take notice that it is the reſolution of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties not to lay down Arms, til the Queene Mother of the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King be ſatisfied and contented, til the Princes, unjuſtly driven out of their eſtates, be reſtored; &amp; til they ſee the aſſurances of peace more certain then to be diſturbed by him who hath violated the treaties of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> &amp; others made before, and ſithence he hath had the managing of the affairs of <hi>France.</hi> Neither do we pretend to draw any other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from the good ſucceſſe, which it ſhal pleaſe God to give unto our juſt proſecutions, then to preſerve &amp; augment the Catholick Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to pacifie <hi>Europe,</hi> to relieve the oppreſſed, and to reſtore to every one that which of right belongeth unto him.</p>
